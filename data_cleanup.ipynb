            "I Knew My Ex's Suicide Was Possible But Didn't Think It Would Come So Soon. Feeling Grief For Everyone Involved. My ex-boyfriend took his own life last week after a long and tumultuous battle with Borderline Personality Disorder. It was a condition that ravaged his mind and turned our lives upside down on a near-daily basis before I reached my absolute breaking point. We were together for six years and broken up for two when I got the news. As soon as I saw the call from his best friend, I knew there would only be one reason why he was calling. I have been feeling off for the past few days. I feel sad to know that he has lost his life, but more so, I feel this kind of all-encompassing grief for everyone involved. I think of his immigrant mother, who left her home country and divorced his father when my ex was seven years old. She has no immediate family in the US and few friends. Now she is aging, living alone and burying her only child. I think of his stepmother, who also divorced his father but who was always such a kind and sophisticated woman. She maintained a great, caring relationship with my ex even after her relationship with his father ended and he was staying with her during his final days. His sweet stepmother would eventually find his body. I think of his father and the unimaginable relationship that my ex had with him. I think of the unfortunate coincidence of my ex being born on Father's Day to a person that actively told him that he never wanted to have kids and that he only did so to appease his first wife. I think of his best friend, who was asked to help make arrangements after the body was found. In life they were more like brothers. I have so many memories of good times--a retreat to his best friend's house was almost always a a brief (but wonderful!) respite from the torment of his mental illness. I imagine his best friend having to clean up my ex's personal belongings, scouring his email for information on how the suicide occurred and being asked to inform everyone who was close to him, myself included. I think of his roommate, a happy-go-lucky and laid back guy who never complained about anything. Over the years I had gotten close to him as well. I think of how he must feel going back to the apartment and knowing what happened there. I think of all of this coming amidst a long and painful period of pandemic that has certainly worn out everyone's hearts and minds and it just leaves me speechless. I think of all these people debating whether a memorial service is appropriate while a virus continues to spread and it just breaks my heart. Then I think of me. I'm not even sure how I feel about myself. The whole thing is just so surreal.My Ex Killed Himself Yesterday My ex-boyfriend was always an extremely troubled person but I could never understand why. I knew that he grew up in a dysfunctional home, struggled to fit in as an immigrant and had a tumultuous relationship with both parents. In his late 20's, he was prone to extreme emotional outbursts, depression and impulsivity that often left me terrified. My father was similar to my ex and so I normalized this behavior and ended up staying in the relationship--which quickly became abusive--for six years. It was a very difficult six years, punctuated by intense pain and struggle to do everyday things that typical folks often take for granted. Though my ex was very accomplished, got excellent grades in school, once taught himself to be conversational in Spanish in less than a year, eventually earned a doctorate degree and was in incredible physical shape, he was always tormented by invisible demons and always on the brink of a breakdown. He was a lot like the mythological character Sisyphus, who continually pushes a boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down once he made it to the top. It didn't matter what my ex was able to achieve--the moment of glory was only a brief respite before he found himself in Hell again. I left my ex about two years ago after he cheated on me for the second time and it wasn't until I was venting on Reddit about the breakup that someone suggested to me that he might have been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. I had always heard of the condition but never understood it in much detail. However, after looking at the symptoms, it became clear to me that he had an almost textbook case of it. Prior to our relationship, he was in a series of difficult relationships, all of which had ended by crashing and burning. He was always intensely afraid of abandonment and had an unhealthy attachment towards me. He would get incredibly upset if I ever wanted to leave his side, even for a weekend. And though he was very accomplished, he often struggled with creating a sense of identity and finding purpose in life. What did he want out of life? Did he want marriage, children, homeownership, to master his career, to travel the world? The question was always left unanswered. Couple that with his excessive spending and eating habits, seeking sexual gratification outside of our relationship, intense bouts of anger, random periods of heightened paranoia and crippling depression in which he would sometimes lay in bed crying for hours, listening to the same song on repeat, over and over and over again. The only symptom that I never saw him actively exhibit while we were together was suicidal ideation. I found out yesterday that he took his own life and am still trying to process what happened. Has anyone ever experienced this before? Does anyone have any advice? Maybe there is really no answer. But thank you for reading anyways.Deal-Loving Future Brides, Be Careful Before Buying Your Dress on eBay or Another Reselling Site As a deal-loving future bride, I enjoy perusing reselling sites. I have a general idea of what kind of dresses I like and have been particularly interested in a certain brand lately. So, you can imagine my surprise when I found a dress in my size for a very reasonable price! I had to jump on it! Quick, because I'm sure if I don't, it will be scooped up immediately! That was a mistake, because as I learned, there can be a lot of color variation in photos. The dress that appeared off-white or cream-colored in bright light and in stock photos is actually very pink in person. I thought the eBay photos were misleading until I saw a phrase in the description in tiny font: *meadow pink*. UGGGGH. If I hadn't been so quick to pull the trigger on what I thought was a great deal, I would have probably taken more time to carefully read the description. Now I'm burned and can't return it because 1. it technically fits the description and 2. color is somewhat subjective and not a reasonable excuse to return. Don't be like me! Do your research, double-check before you buy and try on first if it's safe to do so.My [31, F] Mother-In-Law [62?, F] Won't Stop Offering Me Food My \\[31, F\\] mother-in-law \\[F, 62?\\] won't stop offering me food. Every time we visit her house, which is about twice a month, she offers me an insane amount of food. A typical day goes like this: 1. She asks if I want tea, then cuts me a slice of apple cake without me asking for it 2. She offers me a bowl of stew 3. She offers me some roasted vegetables 4. She asks if I want roasted chicken and potatoes 5. She asks if I want more tea and another slice of apple cake 6. She asks if I want her to make me waffles 7. She asks if I want to take some lemons home with me 8. She asks me (a grown woman with a full-time job who is married to a grown man with a full-time job) \"do you have enough food at home right now?\" 9. She asks me if I want chocolate bars and when I say no thank you, she literally puts them in my hand as I'm walking out the door 10. She asks if I want to take home any of the above-mentioned things It seemed charming at first, but now I'm concerned. Every time I go there, I feel like all I am doing is being bombarded with requests to eat. I'm a petite person who doesn't need too much food to get through the day. And despite my efforts to be polite and tell her no thank you, I'm fine, I'm full from the first meal you served, etc....it just keeps going on and on...what can I do?Programs For a Small Wedding? Do you think programs would be necessary for a small wedding? My fiance and I are throwing an intimate 30-person ceremony and reception. We're going to start with the ceremony, followed by cocktail hour, dinner, speeches, cake and some dancing. My question is: is it necessary to have a printed program for each guest? Pros: might help people get oriented and minimize confusion when guests are asked to transition (from ceremony-->cocktail, cocktail-->dinner, etc.) Since we're having a small wedding, we won't be hiring a planner or an MC. Cons: an added expense, chance that most programs might just end up trashed/recycled Has anyone ever used programs for their small wedding and found it useful...or a waste? ThanksApologetic Hoover, Part III: Should I Be Concerned? My ex (uBPD) and I broke up about two years ago when he cheated and kicked me out of his house. Unlike previous cheating incidents, I didn't return that time, but rather left him to suffer alone in his own misery. About a year after I left, I got an apologetic Hoover email from him saying that he was sorry and that he was in therapy for depression. He asked me if I wanted an item that I left at his house when I moved out and I said I did not. I told him that I was glad he was in therapy, that I had started dating someone new and was not interested in maintaining any kind of relationship with him. Around this time, I come to find out that my ex ran into my cousin in the city where I live and approached him to tell him how sorry he was for, in his words, \"messing up.\" This was embarrassing but also a little creepy, as my ex doesn't live in the city where he ran into my cousin but I happen to live there. About a year and a half after the breakup, I get another email from him...this time it is indecipherable. It looked as if he had tried to send me a photo on an iPad or something but the attachment didn't work. I responded by saying I didn't know if he meant to send me something but if so, that I didn't want to communicate with him further. I firmly told him to never contact me again. Now, about two years after the breakup, comes Hoover Part III. This time it is in the form of a handwritten letter that was sent to my relative's workplace. Since he doesn't know where I live, I suppose his only recourse was to send it somewhere where he knows there is a connection to me. My relative ended up opening the letter and now I'm even more annoyed and humiliated by the situation. I am sick of him dragging my family into this. While we were together, my ex never showed a SHRED of remorse for any of the despicable things he did to me. I'm not even sure he knows that his abusive tendencies were wrong. But I don't like this recent development--I don't like that he is sneaking around, sending out yet another apology and going against my wish of remaining no-contact. Frankly put, he just needs to f\\*\\*\\* off. I'm not sure how I should feel about this. It makes me feel unsafe. Does anyone have any thoughts or advice?Just got the police report after an accident...and it looks like the at-fault driver’s auto policy is fraudulent. What now? (CA) My car was involved in an accident last week, when another car smashed into it while it was parked in front of my apartment. The car is now totaled. I do not have collision coverage so my own insurance can’t help me out. After several stressful days, I was able to obtain the cover page of the police report, which supplied the at-fault driver’s information. I breathed a sigh of relief to see their auto insurance company and policy number. Yesterday I called up Allstate to file a third-party claim aaaand...there is no record of the driver having an Allstate policy. I called them twice and they have no record of anyone with that name. They told me the policy number provided doesn’t come up at all in their system. I’m not sure what to do next. Should I report this back to the traffic department? Should I assume that this person doesn’t have any car insurance and face the fact I may be out of luck? This entire situation has just been so incredibly frustrating.Parked Car Was Totaled--What Should I Do With It While Awaiting Police Report and Insurance Info? (CA) My parked car was T-boned by another vehicle last week, causing very extensive damage. I am certain that it is totaled. I was home when it happened. When I stepped outside, I could see there were two cars involved and an ambulance, so I am not sure exactly who was at-fault. Police were at the scene. I obtained a police report number from the traffic cop. He told me to contact the number to get the report, which would have details about the driver and whether or not they had insurance. I have insurance but not collision coverage, which I forfeited due to the fact that my car was old and somewhat beat-up. I come to find out today that the report isn't ready and could take up to 30 days to be ready. What should I do with my car in the meantime? I don't want to leave it on the street, where it will inevitably collect street sweeping parking tickets every week. I can't even go ahead with filing an affidavit of non-use because it's still technically parked on a California roadway. And I can't cancel my car insurance, which is due next week, because I need to file the affidavit of non-use beforehand. After the crash, someone left a note on my window saying \"I have the plate of the car that hit you.\" I'm tempted to call the number but at the same time I don't to go off any potential misinformation either. Should I have it towed to a family member's house until the report is ready? I'm guessing it would have to be towed again to a shop when I finally do get ahold of the at-fault person's insurance (assuming they have insurance). Or should I just keep it there and contest the inevitable parking tickets? Sorry if the answer is clear--I'm just flustered and not sure what to do next.My Parked Car Just Got Hit But I Waived My Collision Coverage...Am I Outta Luck? I drive a used 2007 Toyota with 120K+ miles and live in California. When I bought the car, it had significant cosmetic damage to the bumper and since then has incurred several other smaller damages as a result of minor incidents (theft, vandalism). Mechanically, it's a good, reliable car that gets me to and from work. It isn't pretty but it gets the job done. I understand that there are certain risks to living in a dense urban environment and parking on the street and I accept those risks. And for that reason, I waived my collision coverage. That is to say, I devote all my insurance money towards protecting others who may be involved in an accident in which I am at-fault, but none on protecting my own car because I know mine is just one small accident from being totaled. And that's what exactly happened--I heard a uncomfortable ***crunch*** this morning, stepped outside and saw that two cars had gotten into an accident and one swerved into my car, which was parked on the street. One of the cars completely crunched the lefthand side, even causing part of my side bumper to fall off. I tried to open the door but it won't open. Given the age and condition of my car, I'm certain that it's toast at this point. I submitted my claim to Geico and acknowledged that I do not have collision coverage for my old, beat-up car. Am I just outta luck in this situation, or would the at-fault driver's insurance cover part of my totaled car? Sorry if the answer is clear...I'm just shook up from the situation and trying to come to terms with the fact that I'll likely be sharing a car with my spouse now.Wedding Guest List Reduced Due To Covid...Etiquette Regarding Those Who Now Won't Be Invited? I got engaged last Spring, not long after the covid shutdown began. Around that time, my fiance and I were planning a small wedding (50-60) people, including family, friends, a few coworkers and their significant others. After realizing the realities of the pandemic, we have planned to reduce the event to a \"micro wedding\" with a limit of 30 guests. We rewrote the guest list to include only family and a few very close friends. Can anyone provide some insight into the best way to inform people who were part of the original plan but now may not be invited? We never sent out formal invitations but I know I have some friends that might assume they would be invited. How should go about telling them and when would be an appropriate time to do so? Our wedding is scheduled for November. Thanks!Does Anyone Else Notice A \"Rebound Effect\" To Their Health Anxiety? Does anyone else notice a \"rebound effect\" to their health anxiety? For example: notices itchy rash on arm and starts freaking out. Jumps through all these hoops to treat the rash and a week later, it seems to be getting better. Almost immediately after noticing that rash is improving, now starting to notice faint ringing in ear. Was that there before? After several days of stressing, it seems that ringing comes and goes, probably just a normal sensation or a product of anxiety. But now, just as you've decided that you're probably fine and not losing your hearing...WHY IS MY THUMB TWITCHING LIKE THAT?! It's almost as if the brain gets so used to a heightened state of anxiety, that relief creates a void that immediately needs to be filled by another thing to be anxious about. Does anyone else go through this??How Common Is It To Experience Your FIRST Serious Relationship After 30? I am in my early 30's and most of my friends are around that age, give or take a few years. While I do have a good number of friends who are married or in serious relationships (myself included), I also have quite a few who are single but have never been in a long-term relationship. Most all of these friends are pretty stable, well-adjusted people with healthy social lives (at least pre-pandemic.) Some are religious and perhaps have had trouble finding someone who they are attracted to but who also shares their faith. Others have busied themselves with education, career and travel and have just never found their person. Most all have tried online dating to some extent but just haven't been able to click with anyone yet. My question is, how common is it for someone who never dated anyone to find a serious, long-term partner after the age of 30? Any success stories? What I realized is that when I look at my friends who are in relationships, most if not all started dating in their teens or early 20's. Maybe they didn't find \"The One\" at that point, but they were out there and getting experience around that time in their lives. I always think that it's just a matter of time before my friends find partners that they're compatible with, but am wondering what other perspectives people might have on the issue.Item Shipped And Now Stuck in \"Pre-Shipment\"? Advice Needed for Buyer Who Wants Item In Hurry Hi, A buyer bought an item for me and then asked me to ship it ASAP, as it is a birthday gift for someone. I was able to ship out the next day on a Friday. USPS tracking says USPS received the item at the post office where I dropped it off and that it departed the PO on the same day. Now the latest update is that it is in \"pre-shipment\" in another city. Buyer is now asking me to explain what is going on and is probably upset because they think there's a delay. Any advice on how to simply explain what is going on? I've been on eBay almost 10 years and have never seen the \"pre-shipment\" thing. Thanks!Squatter Has Been Living On My Mom's Property During Covid Eviction Moratorium...Not Sure How To Help My Mom My mother and father were estranged for years but both owned a house together, which my mother lived in since they separated about ten years ago after a domestic violence incident and subsequent restraining order. A couple years ago, my father got terminal cancer and insisted that he be able to move back in to the house. My mother didn't want to live with him due to their history. They both got lawyers and decided that my father should be able to live in the house until he passed away and that my mother would move back in after he passed. While my father was sick, my uncle (father's brother) moved in to the house to take care of him. My father died, and no one informed our family until a couple months after the fact. My mother returned to the house to find out that my uncle had been squatting there. When my Mom asked him to leave, he refused and told her that she would need to evict him. Around this time, the coronavirus shutdown began and an eviction moratorium went into effect. So my uncle continued to squat at the house for several months. My Mom recently returned to the house and my uncle threatened her, causing a public scene and screaming at her not to touch anything at the property because it belonged to my father. Cops were called and they told her to take my uncle to court. I am not sure how to help my Mom. She has been sleeping on couches for almost a year and needs to get back into the house. My father left a will stating that the property and assets belong to my mother and myself--my uncle has no legal right to the property or any of the assets. Though my mother owns the house, she is low-income and has been hit hard by covid. The lawyer that she had when dealing with the will says he cannot help because he doesn't specialize in evictions. My question is--what should my Mom do? The latest news is that the eviction moratorium will be extended until the end of December. Can she do anything in the meantime? Does anyone know what kind of legal advice she should seek and is there any way to avoid a lawyer who would charge $400/hour? Is this something that can be settled in a small claims court? I wish I could give her advice on what path to take. Any advice would greatly be appreciated--this problem has been plaguing our family all year and I just want my Mom to be able to return to her own property.Mother's Anger Issues Are Getting Out Of Control My mother has been having a rough time for the past couple years. Without going into too much detail, she is dealing with a number of difficult things: the deaths of two people in our family (including my father), tax issues, drama surrounding her property and now, increasing tension with my sister. The result has been her lashing out about anything and everything. I think she has become addicted to rage. Last week, she planned to get away from the stresses of quarantine by visiting and staying with my sister, who lives about six hours away. She ended up driving there, getting into a huge fight with her and driving back within two days. The other day, I went to visit her and she was upset about absolutely everything. She was upset when I called her to tell her I was coming over, upset when I was telling a very mundane story, upset at the way I answered a question, then upset about my sister again. I very calmly asked her if she was feeling off and if she felt her responses were exaggerated. She responded by blowing up at me, accusing me of being overly sensitive and then giving me the silent treatment. That was days ago. She now is refusing to pick up or answer any calls or messages from anyone in my family. She could be dead now for all I know. My mother has been dealing with a lifetime of challenges, is traumatized and is very stubborn. She will not apologize, recognize that she has a problem or accept alternative perspectives. She thinks that anger \"gets things done\" (despite the fact it's solved none of her problems) and sees no issue with her behavior. She thinks that her lifetime of experience at the School of Hard Knocks trumps anything her young, naive daughters could be saying to help her. I'm not sure what I can do. I worry about her but I also am unwilling to sacrifice my own health and happiness if she does not want to change. I can see her burning out, having a mental breakdown or getting seriously ill in the near future if this behavior continues or god forbid gets worse. A part of me wants to help but in the back of my mind I am also preparing for things to take an even darker turn. Any advice?Has Anyone Ever Dated A uBPD Claiming To Have Depression Instead? Eight months after I ended things with my ex uBPD, I received a weird email from him. He was asking me about an item I left at his mother's house during our breakup. After so many months of no contact, it seemed like an attempt to \"hoover\" me back into conversation. I told him that he could keep the item. He responded by telling me that he was in therapy for depression. He told me that he did NOT have BPD, \"just depression.\" I found it interesting because while we were together, I didn't know what BPD was and never used the term BPD to describe him. While he was never formally diagnosed while we were together, my ex's tendencies seemed to be very in line with BPD. He suffered a traumatic upbringing and was on very bad terms with his parents. All his romantic relationships before ours had crashed and burned to the point he didn't even want to discuss them. I wondered if at some point he had attempted suicide as a result of a breakup. His most marked characteristic was his anger, which was often quick to develop and illogical to understand. Anything could set him off--a phone call, slow wifi, a traffic jam, too much wind on the street, etc. Then entire days would be ruined as I attempted to pick up the pieces from his latest rage-binge. He was only soothed when able to indulge in his impulsive desires. He would quickly inhale food, not eat it, for temporary satisfaction from his anger. He also loved online deals and would shop them compulsively, hoping that a new iPad or car accessory would make him feel better. He also seemed to derive joy from the promise of attention outside of our relationship and cheated on me twice (that I know of at least.) No matter how horribly he treated me, I kept coming back because he seemed so hopelessly attached to me. I couldn't even leave on a trip for a few days without him begging for me to come home. You could tell that he did not want to be left alone, even for a short period of time. At the time I was foolish and misinterpreted this as love. I always got the sense that he didn't know what he wanted in life, which explains why he patterned a lot of his life on other people. While at a personal crossroads, he decided to imitate a close friend. He followed that friend's career path down to a T, even going so far as to go to the same schools, get the same credentials and work at the same facility as said friend. But at the end of the day, it wasn't what he really wanted and so he became miserable in his career after only a year. After that, he began patterning himself on other men--sometimes men who were much younger than him and at a very different stage in life. It was awkward and uncomfortable to witness but it seemed to give him a sense of purpose to act like these guys. As our relationship went on, my desire for marriage/stability/children increased and he became increasingly disordered and even more prone to emotional outbursts. This usually consisted of him getting unreasonably angry and exploding on me, usually over nothing. These fits were unpredictable and could be caused by anything at all. After our breakup, I tried to write a list of these traumatic incidents and the list quickly grew to over 100 items. If food, a new gadget or the prospect of sex with another woman didn't help him out of these fits, long bouts of listening to songs of \"longing\" did. He once listened to the same song on repeat for hours on end because the song evoked feeling \"empty inside.\" He apparently was soothed by songs like this. I am not a mental health professional but have met several people with depression and nothing my ex did ever reminded me of someone with depression. Yet during our time together, I didn't know what BPD was and so the phrase was never uttered. I suppose I am confused as to how he could say he was receiving professional therapy for depression when he seems to be so aligned with BPD. Perhaps it was just wishful thinking, as depression is a lot more common and a lot more treatable than BPD. TLDR: Has anyone ever dated a uBPD who later went on to be treated for depression?How To Respond To Weirdly Friendly Banter With Buyer? Sold an item yesterday. Less than 24 hours later, I get a message from the buyer asking how I'm doing and if I shipped the item yet. I thought it was a little odd but didn't think anything of it. I happened to ship the next day and so upon returning from the post office, I messaged them to say I was doing fine and that the item should arrive in 2-3 days. A few hours later, I get another message from the buyer saying they're sorry they took so long to respond because they were at work. Then they ask me if I'm doing okay again. Apparently they could see that I was located in a city that recently had a large protest and asked if there had been a riot there. This is making me uncomfortable and I'm not sure how to respond. I want to provide good customer service but this is too much for me. Would you ignore this message, or would you respond?Wedding Planning Ideas When Date Is Uncertain? Earlier this year, I was in full-blown wedding planning mode, meticulously poring over every detail to optimize our 10K budget while our date was yet to be set. Now that we are living in uncertain times, most of those plans have been put into question. How many people can I invite? Will my venue be available? How will the economy or a recession impact my event? At the same time, I now find myself with more time on my hands than ever. I want to be prepared for the future but not take on too much financial liability. Some of the things I think are safe to think about and plan for: 1. Wedding outfit. Regardless of the event, I know that I'll be dressed up for it! 2. Cake--even if it's a small group, I know there will be cake :) 3. Wedding website--a lot of these are free and now there's plenty of time to think about templates and colors Does anyone have any other ideas or inspiration for wedding planning during uncertain times?Those Who Left A Relationship With A BPD--Is There A Place That Still Haunts You? Every time I go on a domestic flight, I find myself in the same terminal of the airport. In that terminal, there's a little restaurant in the corner. The food there is bland and overpriced. There's a little bar on the side of the place with a TV that's usually broadcasting sports. I'm lucky in that I get to travel several times a year, but every time I see that place, my blood runs cold. It reminds me of the time I booked the wrong flight for a trip with my ex, a uBPD. It was a flight to an out-of-state wedding and when my ex learned of my mistake, he literally ran off in the airport and disappeared for several HOURS. I owned up to the error and was willing to make up for it, even if it cost me a lot of money. We were going to a wedding out of state and needed to make a quick decision if we were going to buy another ticket. But he wouldn't pick up his phone. I was lost and confused in a very stressful place. When he finally did come down from his epic rage fit, he agreed to meet me at that bar. As traumatizing as it was, I was relieved to actually just find him again. We bought some expensive mediocre food there and watched a basketball game on TV. For those of you who left a BPD relationship, are there places that still give you the creeps?Turns Out He's Not Going To Propose I sort of had this hope that my boyfriend would propose to me during our upcoming anniversary next month. He had said a few times that he wanted to wait \"at least a year.\" We are both 30, settled into our careers and our relationship has moved pretty quickly so far. We exchanged \"I Love You\"s fast, moved in fast and are taking our first international trip together this holiday season. Last night he told me he wanted my input on an anniversary gift because he \"wanted to do something special.\" Turns out he wants to get me a purse. I know that I probably sound like a massive spoiled brat for saying this, but I am disappointed. I really want to start a family in the next couple years or so but I feel like it's obscene to talk about such a thing when you aren't even engaged. Then to make things worse, you can't talk about wanting to be engaged without feeling weird for pressuring a guy to put a ring on it. As much as I would like to play it cool, the biological clock is real. There is a window to have kids and it's not something you can be too casual about. \"Are you married?\" \"Do you have kids?\" \"Are you thinking about marriage?\" \"You should do the extra work...you don't have kids!\" \"Are you married?\" \"I want to be part of your wedding party!\" \"Wait until you have kids...you won't complain about that anymore.\" \"Have you been talking about marriage with your boyfriend?\" I was in a bad mood last night and it just made me realize how much pressure there is for people, and especially women, to \"have it all.\" You're pressured to have the looks, the education/career, the salary and everything...but are always judged by your personal life and relationship status regardless of how accomplished you are.Target Clothes and Accessories I see you, Target. You know it's Friday and you're preying on me because I've had a long week at work and you know I'm in the mood for some retail therapy. But I know all your tricks. The lighting, the music, the smell of fresh baked cookies pumping through the vents. It's all intentional. Your goal is to get me to spend as much money on crap I don't need as possible. I get that. And I see your new clothing scheme. Back in the day, Target clothes used to be laughable. But now--everything looks like it's coming from a damn boutique! Now Mossimo, Cherokee and Xhiliration are \"Ava and Viv,\" \"A New Day\" and \"Auden\"...how poetic. Not to mention the way you lay your items out makes them seem so special and exclusive, like a display curated for my millennial, hipster-loving heart... BUT...your clothes and accessories are still crap quality! Take for instance the faux leather backpack I bought earlier this month. That bag did not last even 24 hours before the zipper busted. The stylish red checkered scarf, after one wash, was piling and sticking to every article of clothing I own. I had to run to a store to buy a lint roller just to clean up the mess. Those artfully displayed panties are nothing but a mess of tangled fibers now. And I've only been wearing them for about a month. So I have taken a vow to never buy Target brand clothes or accessories again. To me they are no different than the crap you get at Forever 21. NEVER AGAIN.How Do You Approach The Possibility of Marriage Without \"Pressuring\" Your Partner? My boyfriend \\[30, M\\] and I \\[30, F\\] have been dating for a little over 10 months now and have been living together for 6+. We both agree that we are the best partners that each of us has had and after spending our 20s dating around and focusing on school/career, are both on similar paths and looking for something long-term. He comes from a more traditional family and this year, we attended his best friend's wedding as well as his brother's wedding as a couple. He has another close friend and a coworker that are getting hitched in the Spring. I am not from a conventional family, nor did I ever dream of a wedding. However, I know that he values marriage and if it's important to him, then it would be important for me to respect that. We have talked about the future and are on the same page about \"big picture\" things like religion, kids, potentially moving out of state and buying property, etc. That being said, my boyfriend is also something of a sensitive soul. I think he gets anxious easily. For me, it's a little bit awkward to imagine marrying someone but not being able to talk about it casually. Yesterday I asked, \"If you were to plan a wedding, could you see yourself doing a theme?\" Today I was looking at photos from his brother's wedding and when he asked me why, I didn't really have an answer so I said, \"Well, I'm 30?\" as a joke. Then he accused me of \"pressuring him.\" I didn't really see my behavior as pressuring though. I think of pressuring as being pushy, giving ultimatums, nagging, complaining, etc. But then again, he is somewhat sensitive. My question is, how do you deal with the impending possibility of a wedding without \"pressuring\" your partner? Should I just avoid the topic completely? I thought it might be normal or appropriate to discuss some basic things about it, just to see where his head is at. I understand that a man wants to have control of proposing when and where and if he decides to do that, but I don't know how to avoid this pressure that he's referring to.Hoover After 1 Year?! I broke up with my ex, a uBPD, approximately one year ago. I went no-contact and haven't seen or communicated with him since he kicked me out of his mother's condo. He had recently found a new FP (ex girlfriend from college) and cheated on me with her before we broke up. Today, I get an email from him asking if I still want my bike, which I left in his mother's garage. I moved all my stuff out in a day and didn't have energy or space to haul the bike. He sees the bike every day when he parks his car but he chooses to contact me eleven months later? Now he's telling me how he's in therapy and taking medication for his mental health issues. I've always read about hoovering but never experienced it until now...just interesting because it's more evidence that he is uBPD. Anyways, I simply texted him to do what we wants with the bike and have no intention of continuing any contact with him whatsoever. It's just spooky--I thought Halloween ended yesterday! LOLDo I Need To Attend The Memorial For A Coworker I Never Met? I work 8 hours/day, start at 8:00 am and usually have meetings once per month 3:30-5:00 pm (so I stay an extra hour once monthly.) Today, our meeting is being cut short to include a memorial for a coworker who was with our company before I started working there. I never met her but she passed away earlier this year. The memorial is 4:00-5:00, so I technically worked my 8-hour day. Am I obligated to attend this memorial? I feel a little uncomfortable going to this event when I have no connection to the deceased. The memorial also includes prayers and I am not religious.Can I Get Away With Wearing Fur For Halloween? I decided to go \"all out\" this year and have decided to dress up as a character from one of my favorite Victorian era novels for Halloween. I spent a couple hours deciding on the perfect dress and a custom hat made on Etsy. I decided that I needed one more accessory and my heart skipped a beat when I saw the most beautiful, realistic-looking fur wrap/shawl/stole online. The item was pre-owned but looked to be in great condition. The most amazing thing about it was the color--a rich, lustrous purple with a shiny satin ribbon enclosure. It was so much nicer than the cheapo-beapo, wear-it-once-and-it's-destroyed options I was seeing on Amazon, etc. I sent in my offer and was happy to get a good discount on the item. Then it occurred to me: that lovely fur shawl, despite its unnatural purple color, is actually made of real rabbit fur. DUN DUN DUN! I consider myself a pretty conscientious person and would never buy fur otherwise. Can I get away with wearing a second-hand fur accessory for Halloween? Would it be wrong for me to wear it and then tell people it's faux fur if they ask?Dear \"Starbucks Hack\" People I'm looking at you, girl who is blocking my access to the sugar for five minutes while you mix 10 sugar packets into your drink. By the way, that's probably 40 grams of sugar in that drink now. I'm looking at you, dude who thinks it's okay to deny me half and half by emptying the entire container into their half-full drink because it's cheaper buying a full-price drink. You think you're so cool and economical, huh? Sure, you saved yourself 50 cents, but you're also inconveniencing five people who are trying to get to work on time. You know what's really economical, since you value your money so much? MAKING COFFEE AT HOME. Trust me--it's probably 90% cheaper to make yourself a drink at home. Why don't you start doing that and stop holding everyone up?How Can I Deal With My Family's Stories About \"Ghosts\" and \"Demons\" When I Don't Believe In Them? My family is into magical thinking. Everyone in my family has ghost stories. Aside from ghost stories, there are stories about demons--in other words, supernatural forms that have convinced my family that true evil exists. My Mom has stories about encountering a little old lady who supposedly changed into a demon before her eyes. My cousins all have spooky stories about an old and supposedly haunted house they lived in years ago. Then yesterday, my sister tried to convince me that Travis Scott (the rapper who is dating Kylie Jenner) is actually an agent of The Devil. I find these stories cringe-y because while I am not a hardcore skeptic, I just don't believe in them. I think most of these stories can be explained through psychology and anthropology. Every guy I've dated has also been skeptical of ghost and demon stories. How can I respond to my family tactfully when they bring this stuff up? I would feel embarrassed if they did this around my new boyfriend.I Recently Got Promoted And I'm Feelin' Myself A couple months ago, I was promoted unexpectedly. I was expecting a modest raise this year but was shocked to open up my email and find that I was bumped up several steps on the pay scale. Got my first fat paycheck today and all I can say is that I am feeling damn good about myself. That being said, it wasn't easy. It took me two years of working after college, three years of grad school, a failed internship, traveling out of state to complete another internship in a city with very harsh weather, a long interview/onboarding process to start working and two more years of grinding at the lowest pay scale to get here. The learning curve was steep but I stuck with it and now I feel like I'm really reaping the rewards. Through it all, my career has really been my rock. Relationships come and go but there's nothing like being able to support yourself and use money you earned to fund your hopes and dreams. I just feel like I'm KILLING it right now :)How Can I (30F) Deal With Feeling Annoyed In A TACTFUL Way? My boyfriend (30M) is a great guy, but he has one very bothersome quality: he can be annoying. Sometimes it's the things he says. Sometimes it's an inconsistency between what he says and what he does. When he does get annoying, I feel frustration and often get quiet. It's not that I'm giving him the silent treatment per se, but I will just not be as communicative and engaged as usual. Since my boyfriend is very mild-mannered, never really expresses anger and never raises his voice, my reaction is often seen as negative/\\[female dog\\]-y/pissy/whatever in comparison. My question is, how does one deal with feeling frustrated in a TACTFUL way? It seems as easy as just \"talk it out,\" but sometimes, when he's saying that people who are obsessed with credit card points are stupid but then refuses to let me get the credit card points for the flights but then tells me we can't even split the cost evenly (so that we both get the points...) I just don't know what to say! HALP!Why Did My Heart Skip A Beat When I Saw Pumpkin Spice Latte At Starbucks Today? I consider myself a pretty health-conscious person. I know that the pumpkin spice latte is full of sugar and artificial flavors. I recently started sticking to plain coffee and tea to cut down on pricey drinks that are bad for my wallet and my diet. But when I saw the pumpkin spice latte was available at Starbucks today, my heart skipped a beat. I. Was. So. EXCITED!!! OMG IT'S FALL!!!! Why did I react like this when I know better? I know that stores are constantly trying to sell us on whatever the season is--be it summer, back to school, etc...and I never fall for it...but now I'm ready to throw all that away and start drinking pumpkin spice lattes.Why Do People Think Taylor Swift Is An Excellent Songwriter? Taylor Swift is often touted as a great songwriter, because let's be real--she isn't that great of a singer or dancer. But...why do people even think she's good at songwriting? Every time I listen to her songs, I get the sense that a middle or high schooler could produce the same stuff or do better. A lot of her lyrics just don't make any sense. She sings about leaving Christmas lights up until January like it's something rebellious or unique, when in fact tons of people just do that because they're lazy. A lot of her songs are supposed to have a certain tone to them, but then are made awkward by lines that don't really fit. For instance, in \"Lover,\" she sings a sentimental ballad and then drops \"you save all your dirtiest jokes for me.\" So in the middle of this romantic song that might fit in at a wedding, I just get an image of a guy telling penis jokes. Huh. In \"The Archer,\" she boasts, \"I cut off my nose just to spite my face.\" Isn't the point of writing songs to avoid cliches? In \"ME,\" she sings that \"one of these things is not like the others, like a rainbow with all of the colors.\" Is that to say that there are rainbows that don't have all the colors? What point is she trying to make here? Then there's an entire song called \"I Forgot You Existed,\" where she sings (talks?) about not having love or hate but just being indifferent. Because...when you're truly indifferent, you'll write an entire lead-off song about the subject of your indifference? I don't get it. How is Taylor Swift considered a good songwriter?Appropriate Wedding Gift for Boyfriend's Brother? I've been dating my current boyfriend for 7-8 months and am invited to his brother's wedding this November. His brother and I have not met yet, as he lives on the opposite side of the country. In my previous relationship, I attended the weddings of several friends and my ex and I always contributed by leaving a cash gift that we both contributed to equally. What is the proper thing to do in this situation? I imagine that my boyfriend, who is also the best man, will not be leaving a cash gift for his brother. Is it appropriate to leave one just from me? The couple does not have a website or a registry that I know of. I'm sorry if this seems obvious but I've never attended the wedding of a family member (for my own family or a partner's family), so I'm a little bit confused as to the protocol.Ladies of Reddit, How Much Pressure Do You Feel To Be Social? I'm a quiet, introverted person who is often described as shy. Our society tends to favor extroverts, as they are the ones who have the easiest time making friends, creating connections at work, etc. Ever since I was in my teens, I've found social situations to be challenging. It's not that I don't like people--I just find most conversation--particularly small talk, particularly with strangers--to be draining. I usually need to offset lots of social time with some time spent alone to \"reset\" so to speak. I've done things to try to improve, like taking improv classes, reading up \"How To Win Friends...-\"-type self-help books and intentionally putting myself in difficult social situations in an attempt to build up my tolerance to these situations. But it is still so hard. This past weekend I went on a 2-day camping retreat with my significant other's coworkers and by the second day I was starting to break down. I found myself at a dinner table full of strangers and just couldn't keep any kind of interesting conversation going. I know that socializing is easy for some people--in fact, some don't need to work on it at all. Others may be more introverted but at least understand the basic skills required to be socially appropriate. When it comes to me, I have to always work hard and be aware as to not appear unsocial. It's like a muscle that I need to maintain or else it atrophies and suddenly I'm making people uncomfortable. I feel a constant pressure to be social, as it has been my main \"flaw\" for so many years. Alcohol helps some, but these days I feel that the success of that social lubricant can be hit-or-miss. How much pressure, if any at all, do you feel to be social? If you have any trouble being social, what tips/tricks/techniques/mindsets have helped? Thanks.The Word \"Doctor\" Is Used Too Loosely These Days I feel that the word \"doctor\" is being overused and diluted these days. In my opinion, a doctor is either 1. a medical professional who spent many years in school and completed a residency or 2. a PhD who spent many years in school and completed a thesis. Today, everyone wants to be called a doctor. I know several people who graduated from three-year doctorate programs in physical therapy and call themselves doctor. I hope this doesn't come off as harsh, but I don't really see those people as being doctors. Yes, physical therapy is a rigorous program and they play a great role on the healthcare team. But how you can compare that to someone who spent 7+ years studying to be an actual medical doctor? I know another person who works as a physician's assistant (PA.) When I ask her the difference between what she can do and what the MDs can do, she says, \"we are the same. We can do everything the doctor does.\" I don't know if she misunderstood my question, but someone with a master's degree definitely does not have the same job description as an MD. Today, I saw a post from one of my Facebook friends that read...\"five years ago I was nervous to be a student, now I'm nervous to be a professor.\" He got a job teaching a class in the master's program where he graduated a few years ago. I wanted to say, \"no, you're not a professor--you're a lecturer. You also have less than five years experience working in the field.\" They say that a person needs at least five years of working to be competent at their job. I don't mean to come off as a snob, but I have to get it off my chest: the word \"doctor\" is used too loosely these days. Everyone wants to command the respect of being called a doctor, but many of these people are not even putting in half the time.I Still Don't Know How I Feel About Marriage I'm a female who recently turned 30. As you might imagine, it's an age when seemingly everyone around you starts to get engaged, married and pregnant. I've been dating a wonderful man for about 7 months now and I know that marriage is important to him. While I want to be in a long-term committed relationship with him and would like to have children someday, I just can't figure out how I feel about marriage. Why? There are several reasons. 1. I never grew up dreaming of a wedding in any capacity. I come from a nontraditional family comprised of many long-term relationships and very few marriages. 2. As a career-driven person who has earned everything on my own up until this point, the concept of waiting around (and anticipating!) a proposal for something so crucial without too much say in the matter is strange to me. 3. Speaking of proposals, I'm an introverted person and would probably be mortified if I was proposed to in a public setting. 4. The wedding planning process seems stressful and expensive to me. I've been to plenty of weddings and it really bothers me how guests pick apart a ceremony, making petty comments about the food, music selection, length of time spent doing XYZ, blah blah. 5. I know a lot of unhappy, stressed-out married people. So while I do love my boyfriend, want to be with him and want kids someday, I just find the marriage thing to be problematic. I still don't know how I feel about it. Am I supposed to be excited? Am I dreading the prospect of it happening? It may seem simple---just talk to your partner about these things! But it's not simple, because I know it's important to him and it's awkward to say these things to someone for whom marriage is important.Crazy Cat Ladies There's a stereotype about certain single women and a notion of the \"crazy cat lady.\" I would define \"crazy cat lady\" as a woman who lives alone and owns an unusually large number of cats...let's say more than five. Thing is, I've known about three of these women in my life time and despite their single status and their cats, they are not crazy by any stretch. All are accomplished in their careers and earn good salaries. More importantly, they are incredibly nice people who you would want \"on your team\" so to speak. I'm sure there are crazy cat ladies out there who do need help. Some of these people are legitimately in need of mental health care and hoarding animals is a huge safety concern. BUT that being said...seems like there are a lot who don't. Do you know any \"crazy cat ladies\" who aren't crazy at all? I happen to know three!Do People Who Work In One Place For Many Years Inevitably Become Jaded and Gossipy? I have been working in my career for three years. I still feel relatively young in terms of work experience, but have noticed a trend: As time goes on, the more jaded and gossipy people seem to become. When I started my job, I felt like my colleagues were great and that everyone got along. As time passed, however, I noticed people becoming increasingly jaded. We had trainings this week and the prevailing feeling seemed to be that no one wanted to be there. I approached a colleague who, despite working with me for three years in some capacity, completely forgot my name. When I told her I was looking forward to the new work year, she just looked at me and said, \"really?\" During our trainings, people seemed aloof and rude. We did a required meditation session and although the instructor asked participants to please turn off their phones, all I could see were people sneaking their texting and Googling under their tables. When the clock struck 11:00 for lunch, many stood up and left without being dismissed, despite the fact that someone was in the middle of speaking. More disturbing is the fact that every time I talk to anyone or see a group of people talking, they're gossiping about those who they do not like. \"So and so is scatterbrained,\" \"So and so is really a piece of work,\" \"I can't stand that guy.\" One coworker even followed his gossip with a racist comment. Sometimes, I'll even see a person talk poorly about a colleague, then join up with that very colleague to talk poorly about another person. It's insidious. My question is, is this typical for every workplace? Before my career began, I interned in several places and could tell when the workplace was toxic and when it was not. I chose my workplace because I liked the people but now that I've been here a few years, I'm starting to see it become like the places I didn't like. Maybe I'm just naive and this how the world really is? What has been your experience?I'm Deleting My Toxic \"Friend\" Who Has Been Bullying Me Online I know it may not sound like a big deal, but after 10 years, I am getting rid of a toxic Facebook \"friend\" who has been bullying me online for years. We met in college when we lived on the same dorm floor. He is very religious and conservative and I am not. Though I have never been openly critical of him online, he seems to always go out of his way to make snarky comments about me. I am deleting this toxic \"friend\" for several reasons: 1. His comments are mean and inappropriate. I am not an easily offended person, but his most recent posts--about how people who meditate are living \"unexamined lives\" and have no self-awareness, yet are somehow self-obsessed because they don't believe in the same higher power as he might--really crossed the line. 2. He has started to get into arguments with my other Facebook friends. These are people I like. People I don't want subjected to him. 3. He has not read every book I've read, seen every movie I've seen or listened to every album I've listened to--but weirdly, always pretends that he has. I know for a fact that he is looking all the stuff up on Wikipedia when I reference it to make it seem like he is in the know about it all. Why he feels the obsessive need to do this, I do not know. 4. He comments so frequently on my posts that some people have asked if he is my boyfriend. He is NOT my boyfriend. He is actually married, and I have my own boyfriend. My own boyfriend has suggested I get rid of this person and I'm going to listen. So that's it. I'm getting older and I don't have time for toxic people in my life. I don't care if it's a real friend, a virtual \"friend\", an ex or a family member. If they are bringing me down, they need to get out of my life.Facebook \"Friend\" [30, M] That I Have Zero Real-Life Interaction With Is Weirding Me [30, F] Out. How Should I Interpret This? I went to college about ten years ago. Around that time, I added one of my dorm neighbors as a friend on Facebook. We weren't close but we had some classes together and would occasionally eat together in the dining hall with other friends. Since leaving college, I've had zero real-life interaction with this person. That being said, he almost always comments on my Facebook posts. The comments are always trolling in nature. He also remembers my birthday every year, despite the fact I've never put the date on Facebook. I read a lot of books and watch a lot of movies/shows, and he always responds with comments suggesting that he's read the same book or seen the same show. I know for a fact that he hasn't, and that he's just looking up the stuff on Wikipedia or reading other summaries online and then pretending like he knows what I'm talking about. It's easy to say that he's obsessed with me but this guy is apparently married now. Sometimes he even references his wife in the trolling comments that he makes to me. I'm not sure what the deal is. I don't feel like this guy is a threat to my safety in any way but it just weirds me out. When I talk to my other friends from college, they just laugh it off or imply that I'm overreacting. Should I just de-friend/block this person and just move on with life?Facebook Snarkery Has Reached A New Low The other day, I made a post about trying flotation therapy--basically this thing where one floats in a salt water chamber for an hour to meditate and relax. This is what someone posted on my newsfeed in response: \"Self-discovery is an overrated and intellectually dishonest process. In an epistemological sense, it makes no sense at all. As you said, you're trying to find out what works for you and what doesn't. But spoken a different way, you're using unverifiable methods to find something you don't understand the nature of. I mean, let's say someone went into a sensory deprivation pod and happened upon some kernel of truth. How would they know it was what they were looking for, and how do they know if the sensory deprivation pod was what caused them to discover it? What's to say it wasn't just a post hoc rationalization? Anyhow, I honestly find it hilarious that the millennials most obsessed with self-discovery also tend to live the most unexamined lives. Did any of them ever stop to ask themselves if it is reasonable at all to believe in this innatist notion that truth lies within and through quasi-spiritual exercise, one can discover this truth?\" Seriously? I didn't even write anything about \"truth\" or spirituality. The poster in question is an evangelical Christian and while I don't share any of his beliefs of values, I don't outwardly disrespect them either. Suddenly I'm a self-obsessed millennial living an \"unexamined\" life? I don't know whether to laugh or cry.Groupon The first time I used Groupon was to use an online service that supposedly allowed me to use photos on my phone and design them into a printable photo book. BUT the website was so impossibly crappy, I couldn't even upload the pictures to make the photo book. The second time I used Groupon was to buy discounted tickets to an entertainment show. After buying the coupon, I realize that it can only be used on very specific days. It expired in three months and there was literally one opportunity to use it, which I missed. The third time I used Groupon was for a discounted photo shoot. I purchased the photo shoot session assuming that it would take place in my hometown. Then, two days before, I find out that it is actually taking place in a different city that would be very hard for me to get to at the scheduled appointment time due to traffic. I am never, EVER going to use Groupon again for anything. I'm 100% done.Am I A Bad Driver? I noticed a trend when I am driving my friends, family and boyfriend around. They tend to \"backseat drive\" a lot. My boyfriend tells me that I drive too fast. Then I'm not aggressive enough. My sister makes fun of me for not being able to quickly react and find parking. My Mom makes fun of me for not knowing where to park. I've also gotten comments on my supposed tailgating and the way in which I make left turns. That being said, I have a completely clean driving record. The worst I've ever had is a parking ticket for an overdue meter. I rarely get honked at and \\*knock on wood\\*, I haven't been the cause of a traffic accident in many many years. So my question is: do people naturally backseat drive...or am I just a bad driver??A Tale of Two Thirty-Something Singles This week I'm on vacation in the town where I went to college, so I thought it would be nice to meet up with an old friend for dinner. We're both 30-year-old single females. I love my friend but she is more preoccupied with dating than anyone I've ever met. About a year ago, she met a nice guy online and things seemed serious. \"So,\" she tells me. \"I broke up with J\\*\\*\\*\\*.\" \"What went wrong?\" I asked, ruminating on the recent end of my own six-year relationship. \"Well, we were already semi long-distance and he was making no effort to move in with me. He still lives at home and he's just very dead-set on staying in his hometown. I know he can get a job down here if he tried. And if he can't make an effort to move in, how is he going to plan a wedding? How is he going to raise a kid? I got so upset, I just ended things right there.\" I didn't want to tell her that my relationship ended with my ex cheating on me, so I told her that I had gone through something similar. Which was true--my ex had taken years to discuss moving in and also still lived at home at 33. \"Are you still in contact with him?\" I asked. \"No--I de-friended him on Facebook and removed him from all of my accounts.\" \"I think that if a guy is serious about you, he'll make efforts to be with you. It shouldn't feel like you're forcing him to do everything. And it's good to cut an ex off cold turkey if you can. It helps the healing process. The day I left my ex, I never contacted him again.\" I could tell that my friend was listening but also looking down at her phone. \"Oh, it's J\\*\\*\\*\\*,\" she said. I was very confused. \"I thought you said that you weren't talking to him?\" \"Well, it's hard, because a few weeks after I broke up with him, his grandmother died. And I know his family, so I sent his Mom a bouquet. It's hard.\" \"I see.\" \"J\\*\\*\\*\\* says he misses me. He says he's looking for jobs up here. But I told him I'm going on dates with other guys.\" The pleasure that my friend is getting from her lovelorn ex is very palpable. You can tell how much she enjoys showing him what he's \"missing.\" \"Well, I guess since you two are broken up, you're free to give other guys a shot.\" My friend shows me a picture of her latest Tinder date on her phone. He's good-looking, muscular and apparently owns his own house. \"Yeah, I like him, but he's so short.\" I look at his listed height and realize he's a good two inches taller than the guy I'm currently dating. \"I just wish things were simple,\" my friend says. \"Why can't things just be simple?\" This interaction with my friend stood out to me because it really highlighted how different I am from her. First off, I would never stay in contact with an ex, much less string an ex along about moving many hours away while I hook up with guys on Tinder. Second off, I don't care about height. I feel like everyone is concerned with height but as a short (<5'5\") woman myself, it seems hypocritical to be so judgmental. Have you ever had a discussion with a single thirty-something friend and was struck by how different your dating philosophies are?!30, Confused and Ruminating On Marriage And Baby Pressure I suppose I should start this post by saying that I am a very confused 30-year-old woman. Last year, I ended a long-term relationship of 6 years with a man I thought I would settle down with. The relationship was unhealthy in many ways but I think I stuck it out for much longer than I should have because he was my first serious boyfriend. Fast forward and I've now been in a much better relationship with a new man for six months. That being said, because I am 30, I am starting to get lots of comments about marriage even after this short time. One of my friends (albeit a very conservative friend), asked me if I wanted to marry him. I told her 6 months was not enough time. Then instead of accepting my view, she doubled-down on her opinion, insisting that 6 months WAS enough time. Another friend texted me a photo of an event happening at a park. I told her I liked the park because I had gone on a date there with my current boyfriend. She started gushing and talking about how she wanted to be part of my \"wedding party.\" Another friend also mentioned that she wanted to be invited to this wedding that is not even planned. I just feel like marriage and/or the subject of children is a deeply personal one and shouldn't be thrown around so flippantly. I would never make such a comment to someone, but why do people feel the need to make them to me? Is it because Facebook culture is constantly showing us engagement photos? Is it because there's a multi-billion dollar wedding industry in this country? Is it because people just repeat things that have been said to them without thinking? Either way, 6 months really is not enough time. Even if I wanted to get married, bringing the subject up just feels uncomfortable to me. I can't help but feel desperate, as if I'm just using him to gain social status or make the comments stop. I'm not sure if any of this makes sense but I just had to get it Off My Chest.Peer Pressure To Marry After 30 From age 23-29, I was in a long-term relationship with a man I thought I would marry. I kept waiting for the day when he'd feel settled and secured enough for us to take the relationship further, but the day never came. First it was that he needed to apply to grad school. Then he needed to finish grad school. Then he needed to study for board exams and land a job. Then he landed his dream job and just needed to \"get used to his job.\" He started to get paid and then he needed to pay off some student loans. I kept waiting and waiting and then one day, I walked into his room and saw that he had been sending sexy texts to an ex from his college days. Shortly after, I put all my stuff in garbage bags and retreated to my parents' house. Our relationship had been crumbling for a while before that point, and part of the pressure came from approaching 30 and getting lots of questions and raised eyebrows about when we'd be getting married. On top of his disinterest in committing, he also started to sound unsure about kids--something that is a dealbreaker for me. So really, there was no other choice but to end that relationship. I recently turned 30 and have been lucky enough to sustain a great, healthy relationship with a new man for the past 5 months. But yesterday, I had this conversation with a friend: Friend: So, when are you going to get married? Me: Well, I just got out of a 6-year relationship and have only been with my new guy for five months. I think it's a little too early to be talking about marriage. Friend: 5 months is a long time! Me: Oh yeah? The majority of people I've talked to don't think so. Friend: 5 months is long enough Me: I feel like most people won't even take you seriously until you've been dating someone for a year. Friend: Things move fast at our age--5 months is long enough to know if you're ready to get married. Me: ??? It is just me, or is my friend being rude? Or am I being too sensitive? I have a lot of friends--some married, some in relationships, some single and looking, some single and seemingly comfortable that way. I've never asked a single person why they're single, or a coupled person when they're getting married, etc. It just seems like that isn't my business.Boyfriend [29,M] Never Gets Angry. When Annoyed With His Behavior, I [28, F] Always Come Off As A \"Bitch.\" Help Me Break This Cycle. My boyfriend is very calm and does not get angry. He does not raise his voice. He is calm as a cucumber. It's great, but like any human being, he is not perfect. For instance, he does some things that regularly annoy me. For instance, when we are having a conversation and I bring up a point, often he'll say, \"to take it further...\" I hate when he says that, because it makes me feel as if my point/opinion was minor and/or missing The Big Picture, and implies that he is the one who understands The Big Picture. I had a conversation about how much this annoyed me but I still find him saying it from time to time. I don't think he means harm, but the way he says it always makes me feel like I'm stupid. When I get annoyed, my natural reaction is to roll my eyes, cross my arms or become silent. This in turn makes me come off as a bitch. However, tonight I wondered--am I really being that much of a bitch? Isn't annoyance a human emotion? Is it fair to compare yourself to someone who never outwardly displays anger or annoyance? How can I express frustration in a healthy, constructive way without seeming like a \"bitch\"? I feel like any negative emotion compared to person who never gets angry is going to appear exaggerated.Phone Calls I Used To Have with my pwBPD While I Was On Vacation It's a late night and I'm on my annual summer vacation. I've had too much iced coffee to sleep and now as I lay in my hotel bed, I can't help but remember where I was a year ago. I had been dating my pwBPD for almost five years and was staying in this same hotel. The system I had with my ex was that we would call one another around 10 PM on any night that we did not see each other. If I was on vacation, this usually meant that we'd be talking for five or six nights in a row. My ex had a pattern when it came to these phone talks: 1. He tended to zone out of conversations completely, which usually lead to me talking 90% of the time. Even while checking out new places in a new city, he'd respond to everything I said with \"uh-huh,\" \"okay\" or \"oh, yeah?\" Oftentimes, I could hear that he was playing a video game in the background, what with the sound of the keyboard clicking. Occasionally, he'd lash out at me for \"not being able to tell a story,\" as if I had to have the command of a performing artist at all times to hold his attention. If I explained something in a way that confused him, he'd usually erupt in anger and start insulting me. 2. If he did participate, it was usually to rant about the same miseries in his life: first and foremost his job, then his painful (but in reality, pretty standard) commute to said job, then random injustices: something his mother said to him, the laundry machine not working, wifi slow at home, etc, etc. If he was angry enough, sometimes he'd just hang up the phone on me like a child. Sometimes he'd \"rage quit\" our talks for multiple days. 3. Every once in a while, he'd mix things up by telling me about a catastrophe that was going on, as if to drive my attention away from the vacation and towards him. Once it was an emergency because his professional license wouldn't go through due to a prior misdemeanor on his record. Another time it was an ankle injury sustained at the gym. He would be frantic and there would be nothing I could do to help him. 4. Towards the end of our relationship, he began telling me that he didn't miss me while I was gone. I found myself dreading these conversations and just hoping and praying that they would go decently so that I would not be stressed out and worried for another 24 hours to follow. I just wanted things to go smoothly so that I could go on with the next day with a clear head. Looking back, it's really hard to imagine why I put up with that horrific behavior for so long. It's simply mind-boggling. I don't have to deal with it any more and I will never put up with it again from anybody. But what if I hadn't been able to walk away? That's one thought that'll keep you up at night. That and being dumb enough to drink iced coffee at 6 PM.Thoughts On A Common \"Why Am I Still Single?\" Conundrum I've been lurking on various dating-related subreddits over the past six months and I've noticed a pattern. The pattern involves posts that usually go something like this: \"I don't know why I'm still single. I've been told that I'm attractive, I have a Master's degree and a stable career, I work out regularly, I've got a great dog, I love to travel, I have my own apartment and/or a mortgage, I go hiking with my friends all the time, I volunteered for Peace Corps, etc. I've been told I'm a great catch, I have no idea why no one wants to date me!\" I don't mean to sound harsh, but when I see posts like that, my first thought is usually, \"Hmmm...alright.\" When I reflect on my dating history, remembering previous partners and people that I was romantically interested in, I don't think I've ever wanted to be with someone BECAUSE they had a certain degree, job, fitness level, set of interests, pets etc. Those things are all nice, but they are not requirements. In fact, and I don't mean to come off as a snob, but those things can be somewhat standard in certain places. If you live in some parts of the country where the cost of living is high, a Master's degree may be the new bachelor's degree, salaries tend to be generous and most people have some kind of a health and wellness routine. It's just a demographic fact. And if that's the case, how do you differentiate yourself in the dating pool, or better yet, find someone? This is my own opinion, but I feel like people focus too much on creating a \"dating resume\" of sorts and should focus more on compatibility on big-picture things, like whether or not their potential partner is at a similar \"stage\" in life (sowing oats phase or settling down phase, depending on what you want), whether or not they want a serious relationship (again, if you want), cultural and religious values, financial habits, kids vs no kids, etc. Attraction is subjective and will get your foot in the door but compatibility on those levels are going to matter more than yoga, how many countries you've been to, the half marathon you ran, your knowledge of jazz music, how much you love your corgi, etc. JUST MY TWO CENTS.New Boyfriend Is Depressed...Please Advise I've been dating a new guy for about 5 months. After our first date, he admitted that he suffered from depression. My last serious boyfriend had undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and our relationship was very traumatic, so when my current boyfriend mentioned mental health issues I was a little concerned. He said that his depression was the worst during college, which was about ten years ago. He told me that he was suicidal at the time. Since then, he said that he felt depressed on and off but that most of it was due to loneliness, as he had been single and working a very stressful job for most of that time. Our relationship has been great so far. We treat each other well, are very compatible and have similar long-term goals. He recently left his stressful job in favor of one with better hours and higher pay. Then seemingly overnight, he tells me that he's depressed. When I ask him to describe the feeling or talk to me about it, he only offers vague details. I know that there is no correlation between life achievements and depression (in other words, I do not think depression can be cured by getting a girlfriend or a better job), but I'm a little taken aback. Up until this point, everything has been smooth sailing. I know it sounds selfish and I know nobody's perfect, but I am traumatized from caring for my mentally ill ex and the thought of going through it again worries me. Today he told me that he was depressed as he left for work, leaving me with a sense of dread. I told him I was concerned and afraid and he said that my reaction was \"the opposite of what he wanted.\" When I asked what he wanted, he said he wanted me to say that it was okay and that we'd get through his depression together. I want to be positive but given my previous relationship experience, it's going to be challenging. I just don't know where to even start. **TLDR: My ex had Borderline Personality Disorder and now my current boyfriend mentioned he has depression, not sure where to start**.At A Crossroads Regarding Repair to My Rear Bumper (2007 Toyota Matrix XR) Hi, This is my car: a 2007 Toyota Matrix XR. Mechanically, the car has run great for the past 1.5 years since I bought it. However, as you can see, there is some very noticeable damage to the bumper as well as the right side of the hatch door from where it was involved in a minor accident before I bought it. Yesterday, I took it to a body shop and they told me that aside from cosmetic damage, there may be structural damage and that I would need to sign a waiver if I get the bumper replaced but don't address said structural damage. My question: is it likely that there is structural damage beneath, and if so, how serious might it be? Does it pose a considerable safety risk to me as a driver that I would be foolish to ignore? https://preview.redd.it/ai75s8fdsd031.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1d2e62462eddf29e425e8a9192697cddb258bb3Post Scrubbed From r/MechanicAdvice, At A Crossroads Regarding Potential Rear Bumper Repair? Hi, This is my car: a 2007 Toyota Matrix XR. Mechanically, the car has run great for the past 1.5 years since I bought it. However, as you can see, there is some very noticeable damage to the bumper as well as the right side of the hatch door from where it was involved in a minor accident before I bought it. Yesterday, I took it to a body shop. They told me that the bumper would cost $750 to replace and the spoiler underneath would be an additional $220. However, they also cautioned me that there could be structural damage beneath the cosmetic damage, in which case I would have to sign a waiver acknowledging that there was such damage should I choose not to address it. I don't know much about cars. My questions are: 1. Is it necessary to have the spoiler replaced? Is it just there for aerodynamics/aesthetics? This car is older, has various dings/scrapes all over and I do not drive very fast in general. 2. Is it likely that there is structural damage beneath, and if so, how serious might it be?

One of my relatives passed away last year. He was a small business owner and at the time of his death, had \\~$100,000 in a retirement account (my parents describe it as an \"IRA\" but don't specify the type). He has 10 remaining relatives that are named as his beneficiaries. My parents say that \"because of the way the will was written,\" the disbursement goes to his small business account, and then is taxed at a really high rate because his business was in a high tax bracket (they said 37% for federal and 10% for state). Is this right? I'm confused, as I feel like the disbursement is not the same as income for the business. Following that logic, out of \\~$10,000 that each of us inherits, we would only receive $5,300 after taxes? Why isn't the $10,000 given to the beneficiaries and then taxed at our own individual tax rates (which are much lower)? Does anyone know the answer to this, or know who I can ask for an answer? Thanks!Do People Who Have Only Been In One Relationship In Their Life Think About What It's Like To Have Sex With Other People? I was with my first serious boyfriend for several years. Before we met, I had been single for a long time. I was so happy to be in a real relationship and to lose my virginity after having no luck during high school and most of college. A few years into the relationship, however, I began to wonder: what if he turns out to be the ONLY person I have sex with in my life? The thought was daunting. After a while, won't it get really predictable and boring? I found myself constantly thinking about what it would be like with other people. We ended up breaking up, and now I know what it is like to have sex with more than one person in my life. All I can say is, it's pretty awesome. But I wonder: how many people also feel this way? And is feeling that way an indication that you're in a bad and/or dead-end relationship, or is it just human nature to want to experience other people sexually? I'm curious, but I'm not going to go up to my one-and-done friends and ask, hey, do you ever worry about having sex with just one guy? Do you ever think about having sex with your Starbucks barista?BPD Loved Ones, Has Pete Davidson Had Any Influence On Your Understanding Of BPD? I remember the first time I heard about Pete Davidson. I never really watched SNL but found out about him shortly after his whirlwind romance and short-lived engagement to Ariana Grande. He seemed like a typical goofy comedian until one little detail was mentioned: he had been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Huh? I thought. \"Why would ANYONE date someone with Borderline Personality Disorder?\" Up until that point, my only experienced with BPD was during a 3-month internship I had at a community-based center for people with severe, disabling mental illnesses. I remembered interacting with pwBPD that were unable to pay their bills, wash dishes after a meal or even take a shower. One time, my supervisor introduced me to such a person for the purpose of an intervention. We were there to see if we could implement a cleaning schedule for her and she ended up screaming at us for 45 minutes straight about how the center was stealing her money behind her back. Another person with BPD that we visited lived like a hoarder. She piled items all around her apartment, where she was unable to bathe because she had been molested in a bathtub as a child. We once spent the entire day just trying to clear a path in her apartment so that she could get in and out in the event of an emergency. So I was puzzled...why was Ariana Grande engaged to someone with BPD? It was then that I realized that, like other mental illnesses, BPD is on a spectrum. I had no idea. And at the time, I had been dating a uBPD for over four years, knowing full well that something was wrong with him but at the time, not having the knowledge or tools to figure out what it was. Like many undiagnosed men who probably have BPD, my ex exhibited signs that were easily misinterpreted as anger management issues, depression or both. Case and point, Pete Davidson's discussion about his mental health is one of the reasons why I was able to understand that my ex was a uBPD. And luckily for me, I was able to escape that terrible, toxic relationship and am now free. BPD Loved Ones, anyone else go through something similar?For Those Of You Have Sent Offers To Buyers And Had Them Accept...What Are You Doing That I'm Not? Let me start off by saying that I love Best Offer. Since Best Offer has become a thing, I'll bet that 80% or more of my sales come through Best Offer. Thank goodness for that! BUT...when it comes to sending offers to buyers, I cannot get a single person to bite. I've probably sent about 25 offers since the feature was implemented, but nobody cares. I usually offer the kind of discount that I would like to see offered to me--roughly 20% off my asking price. But no one ever accepts. Has anyone been able to send offers to buyers with any luck? If so, what are you doing?People Who Frame Everything You Do In The Context Of \"It's Because You Don't Have Kids.\" Let me start by saying that I have nothing against kids at all. What I have a problem with are overzealous parents. I'm in my late 20's, single and have no kids. I have a graduate degree, zero student debt, an online selling business (side hustle) and a job that allows me ample time to travel throughout the year. I go on vacation every 1-2 months. It is not uncommon for me to travel solo, as I am somewhat introverted and find traveling alone to be fun and refreshing. The response from CERTAIN coworkers is always the same. While not put explicitly, it's always, \"you can do that because you don't have kids.\" Dress well? It's because you don't have kids--we mothers have to walk around covered in poop and vomit all the time. Don't like cleaning water bottles? It's because you don't have kids--we mothers have to clean baby bottles all the time. You read a book? It's not because you're a literate person---it's because you have so much time because you don't have kids. Um...no. I do what I do in my life because I'm awesome. And guess what--even if I did have kids, I'd still be cooler than you, asshole. When people make those kinds of comments, all it does is reinforce my belief that a lot of people actually regret having kids and/or wish they had waited before having them. Alright, I'm done!The New Taylor Swift Song (\"Me\") Is The Worst Song I've Ever Heard I am not a Taylor Swift fan by any means, but I do like some of her songs. I would say that 1989, in general, is a solid pop album. That being said, her new single, \"Me\", is just unbelievably awful. It's almost unfathomably bad. I don't even know where to start. Maybe we can start with the opening metaphor of a snake turning into a butterfly in the music video. This is so cringe-inducing, it hurts for me. Her last album, Reputation, was by far her worst. From her wannabe thug cover art, to her \"Hey guys, I'm old enough to drink wooo hoo!\" theme, to her lyrical cliches that were heavy enough to sink an army ship, to the monotonous thud of half the attempted singles, to the \"Hey guys, I'm old enough to have sex now yeah baby\" theme...it was just an absolute mess. Though I am not a fan, a part of me hoped that she would return to a more honest, mature kind of songwriting...to perhaps show that she had developed some insight as a woman who is nearly 30. I couldn't imagine anything being worse than Reputation...then I heard \"Me!\" Now we are to believe that Swift arose from this dark, traumatic Reputation era to become a beautiful butterfly. GAG. I thought she was owning the \"snake\" thing as a brilliant comeback to Kimye's disses...you know, in the same way that Eminem uses the disses of his rap opponents in 8 Mile to outsmart them...oh, no? Nevermind. Guess not. I guess she's a magical unicorn princess after all. It's like she's doing an incredibly cheesy satire of Katy Perry, who actually does the pastel/cutesy/kitschy thing well. It pains me when people say that she is a talented lyricist. In \"Me!\", she writes, \"One of these things is not like the others, like a rainbow with all of the colors.\" WTF??? So she's saying that a rainbow with all of the colors is not like...other rainbows, which usually have only some colors? Or she's saying that a rainbow--which is an incredibly unique looking thing--is unlike other things, which are unnamed and undoubtedly not comparable to a rainbow? I'm so fucking confused. \"Me!\" is just so bad. Not in a good way. In a very, very bad way. It's just fucking terrible.Dear \"People\" In The Hotel Room Next To Mine What kind of barn were you heathens raised in? It's 2:00 AM in the morning. You know FULL well that there is only one thin door separating our rooms. How do you know? Because one of you nitwits went ahead and opened it while I was laying in bed, despite the host telling you that it lead to my room and to leave it alone. Now you're blasting EDM music and cursing loudly. At 2:00 AM. You know FULL well that someone is probably asleep in the room next to you. Do you give a shit? No, because a tiny bed and breakfast in a vacation destination that mostly caters to retirees is the obvious place to throw a Vegas-inspired hotel party. For those of you who will criticize me for not complaining to management, consider this: I am female and traveling alone. Imagine that I complain and then one or more of these three (four?) party people--who seem to have about as many brain cells between them--decides to retaliate against me in their drunken stupor. I would be outnumbered. It just doesn't seem worth the risk to me. I just can't fathom how people can be so insensitive. I walked nearly 10 miles today and am exhausted. I have to wake up early, drive to the airport and fly halfway across the country before I can find the comforts of a warm bed again. Seriously, these people can go straight to Hell. I wish them the very worst.New Boyfriend Is Too Smart...Help Me, My Brain Hurts I just got out of a long-term relationship with a guy who wasn't dumb, but wasn't an intellectual, either. I've always liked to read and discuss deep things but it wasn't encouraged with him, so my brain sort of atrophied over that time. I'm currently dating a very smart guy. He isn't pretentious about it, he just loves to learn stuff. He's into all kinds of topics and knowledgable about all kinds of things. It's nice and different, but damn, my brain is getting tired. He's the type of person who can watch an abstract movie and immediately interpret it in terms of historical, political and philosophical themes...while me and our friends just stand there and stare. I liked him and all...he's sweet and faithful to me. Our physical connection is intense and the sex is great. I think he'd be a good husband and a good father potentially. But my GOODNESS...my brain is tired from thinking so hard. Should I start reading the encyclopedia or should I just give up?!?! HELP. MY BRAIN HURTS.My Boyfriend Laughed Hysterically At Me During Sex...Feeling Slightly Traumatized By It. Help! Let me start by saying that today was unusually great for me. I had a light day on the job, completed a vigorous workout, had a delicious dinner and then watched a funny movie with my new boyfriend over a couple glasses of wine. Basically, the definition of an amazing day for me. After feeling so good and drinking, naturally, I wanted to have sex. My boyfriend protested, saying he was too tired, but once we got to bed we started to tease each other and one thing led to another. I got super aroused, we started doing it and it felt AMAZING. I was super into it and feeling myself too. I would say that dirty talk is one of my strengths and so I started talking dirty. I thought I was doing a fantastic job, too. I felt like he was ready to come at any moment. And then I made a crucial error--I said something using the exact phrase from the comedy movie we had just watched. It was a stupid mistake and I'm sure the wine had plenty to do with it. My boyfriend lost his erection and immediately started laughing hysterically. In fact, I've never seen him laugh so hard at anything. He was on the verge of tears. He then told me that it was \"the funniest thing that ever happened to him.\" I know that people should be able to laugh at themselves, but I found the situation pretty mortifying. I feel like there's a time and place to be funny but that certainly wasn't the time or place for it. I'm legitimately feeling humiliated. I felt like I was close to an orgasm myself and then I just hit a wall. I want to be sexy for him. I don't want to be a comedian. Am I being stubborn or unreasonable? I actually feel like I could benefit from taking a short break from having sex to recover from this incident. I've had embarrassing sexual encounters before but now it's hard for me to separate myself from this ridiculously dumb thing I said in the heat of the moment. Any advice on how to get over it?Grown Adult Acting Like A Kid At Starbucks I'm at my local Starbucks. Some loud-mouthed lady starts holding up the line. She's at the cash register for several minutes, then starts raising her voice at the barista. She's accusing her of something involving a gift card. She accidentally pushes over one of the small signs, knocking it to the ground. The manager comes to pick it up. She then goes on a ten-minute tirade to the manager about how she didn't like the way the barista interacted with her. The manager is standing there, dumbfounded. He talks to her calmly and then leaves. Now she is hounding the barista again, giving her dozens of directions regarding her order. The barista is trying her best to remain calm and do her job. The loud-mouthed lady starts sipping her drink and is now back at the cashier, asking where the manager is. The barista tells her that he left for the other Starbucks up the street, which he also manages. Loud-mouth asks if the cashier can call the manager. These poor kids...just trying to do some work on top of high school or college and having to deal with this mess. I understand that people have mental health issues and whatnot, but it just pisses me off so much. The barista is offering the lady the manager's card and phone number, but she is insisting that SHE call the manager and specifically ask him to call her back. If it was socially acceptable for me to punch people in the face, I'd punch her right now.The Health Incentive Plan At My Job Sucks So Hard Now When I started working 2.5 years ago, my job had a great health incentive program. 1. You could earn points for clocking in 10,000 steps or more on a fitness tracker, then use the points for Amazon gift cards. 2. If you recorded 200 days of 10,000 steps or more, you could qualify for a $200 rebate on a gym membership 3. Depending on what status level you earned, you could earn up to $400 in an FSA 4. Everyone could play an online game for the chance to win $500, regardless of your status NOW: 1. You need TWICE as many points to earn the same amount in gift cards as you did before...in other words, it takes 20,000 points to earn the same gift card that I was able to obtain for 10,000 in the past. 2. The gym rebate is nowhere to be found...does it still exist? 3. The max you can earn in the wellness FSA is $200 now 4. Only those in the highest status have a chance to win the $500, whereas before, everyone could enter. The Health Incentive Plan at my job blows now...what happened? Were people being too healthy or something? JEEEZ. &#x200B;Why Is It So Hard To Be The First One To Leave A Social Situation? We've all been there. You're at a social gathering that is dragging on and on and nobody is into it anymore. You're done with work for the day and people are chatting and making small talk by the door although it's pretty understandable that everyone wants to go home at that point. Maybe some of those people even mentioned having to get back to their families or eat dinner not long before. Why is it so hard to be the first one to leave? Or initiate a goodbye gesture? Seems like people would rather mill about for long periods of time then simply say, \"Alright, gotta go!\"People Who Are Dating Someone They Met \"IRL\", Would You Have Swiped Right On An App? I'm in my late 20's and never tried online dating. I had an interesting conversation with a guy that I met in \"real life\" and have been dating for a little over a month. Prior to me he had been on several dating apps. He said that if he had seen my profile on Tinder, he would have swiped left because he would have assumed that I would not have been into him (or perhaps he thought I was out of his league.) Makes me glad I didn't do online dating! \\*Whew\\* For people who are dating someone they met in real life--do you think you would have swiped right?My [30, F] New Boyfriend [30, M] Apparently Dated My Friend [30, F] Before We Got Together...Going To See Her Next Week. How Do I Play It Cool? About ten years ago, I was really close to this one girl in high school. We hung out all the time and were very good friends. We went off to different colleges, had different careers, etc, and just grew apart. I recently got into a new relationship with a guy from my high school circle and he just revealed to me that he dated this former friend of mine. He also let it slip that she did something to him sexually that launched him into a specific kink/fetish. Huh. Maybe that part should have been left out LOL. We are going to see this friend next week at a mutual friend's birthday gathering. How do I play it cool? I like this girl a lot. We have a history of good times together from our teen years. But now I cannot get the image of her banging my guy out of my head. My only advice to myself is to avoid drinking too much, as things could get weird very fast and I am something of a lightweight anyways. Any other advice? Thanks. &#x200B;Sexual Awakening At Almost 30? I lost my virginity in my early 20's. I was in my first serious relationship and it actually took me quite a few weeks to warm up to and enjoy sex. My partner had a nice body that I grew to really crave/desire but sex mostly consisted of him calling me demeaning names during the act and then refusing to discuss sex ever because he believed it killed the mystery of it all and that it shouldn't need to be explained. As time went on, our sex life fizzled out completely and he started telling me that it was because I wasn't feminine/sexy enough and didn't know how to turn him on. He eventually cheated on me and we broke up. I re-entered the dating scene demoralized, single at 29 and feeling like it just wasn't going to be in the cards for me. That was until I met my match: my current boyfriend. This guy turns me on in so many ways. Ways that I did not know were humanly possible. Not only is he very skilled and experienced sexually, but we connect so deeply on an emotional and intellectual level. It adds so much dimension to the sex. When we are together, we fuck like rabbits. I have never felt more desirable and thrilled in my whole entire life. What makes it even sweeter is that I never thought it would happen to me. But it did. At almost 30. I feel like I'm the heroine of some famous work of censored literature or something haha. Is it possible to have your sexual awakening later in life? I feel like my relationship was more of a warm-up to having a sex life. Haha.Received Paypal Payment on eBay Without eBay Sale Notification, Now Paypal Wants To Investigate? Last night I got an email informing me that I received a payment for an eBay item. I thought it was strange because I didn't get a notification from eBay that the item sold. Checked eBay multiple times, refreshing the page, but no...no notification. Later I get an email from Paypal informing me that the payment is under investigation and to not ship the item. The email says \"action requested\" and is asking for some kind of documentation. Check back and now I see a \"Paid--Ship Now\" message on Ebay. Has anyone ever experienced this before? I've been selling for 8 years and never seen such a thing.New Boyfriend Is A Huge Freak...Was Excited About Him And Am Now Depressed. I've been dating a great guy for about a month now. Things have been wonderful so far. We really click on an emotional and intellectual level. Sex so far has been great. But the thing is...he's a pretty big freak. I'm high on relationship experience (my longest being 6 years) while he's low on it (longest one being less than a year). He's high on sexual experience (having been with many partners, friends with benefits, prostitutes, etc.) while I have only been with two guys in my past, both of whom I was in serious relationships with. We got our STI/STD results and everything's good to go, but... The more I get to know him, the more I come to realize that he's a huge freak. It started with him tying me up. I was okay with that. Then he talked about slapping me around, which I will admit weirded me out. I suppose I am a pretty \"vanilla\" type of person. Next came the talk of tying me up and doing me in the butt, followed by the suggestion that I could use a strap-on to do HIM in the butt... I know these things are probably not that freaky to some people, but they are to me...and it just worries me. I worry if I will be \"enough\" to him. I'm pretty much a virgin to all things kinky. We get along GREAT when it comes to non-sexual things but I just don't know if I will be able to satisfy him in a long-term way. This makes me sad, because a part of me really wants to be with him long-term. But I am feeling discouraged. I don't know if I'll actually be able to climb this mountain. Any advice? :(Paranoid About Series of Incidents That Left Me Feeling Trapped I'm not a particularly paranoid person, but a number of incidents in the last 24 hours have left me feeling very paranoid. 1. tried on a blouse in a store, put it on but could not figure out how to take it off. It was if it was glued to me or something. Was super paranoid about getting trapped in it. Five minutes later I find a zipper. 2. ten seconds later...the next top I try on traps me too. I could not believe it. It was a tank top with a really low cut back. I could get it on but for the life of me, could not figure out how to take it off...and was dumbfounded that the same thing happened to me twice in a row. That has never even happened to me ONCE before. 3. today...working with a disabled student who is usually very calm and collected. He is non-verbal. Out of nowhere, he gets extremely upset and grabs my arm...but won't let go. He has a death grip on me and as hard as I try to push, he grips harder. It wasn't until I was able to call for help that he let go of me. Again, this is not something that has ever happened to me before. 4. take another student to the library just to discover that the library is full of students sitting on the floor for indoor recess and that I can't access the therapy room (located on the far end of the library) because it would literally be impossible to navigate with the student. Bring the student back to class. Walk back to the therapy room, traverse the sea of kids and then realize that I am now trapped INSIDE the therapy room because I can't possibly through the crowd of sitting kids with my large rolling cart. Why are all 4 of these things happening to me within a day? Shit like this makes me very paranoid.Meeting His Friends For the First Time...God Help Me I've been dating a great guy for a month. Connection is very strong. Chemistry is great. I'm meeting his friends for the first time this weekend. It's going to be a birthday thing at a dive bar. I don't know any of these people and am extremely nervous. I'm pretty introverted. I also don't really go to dive bars--I'm more of a lounge and cocktail type of gal. I mostly drink with other girls. I don't know how to dress or what to order. God help me. Any advice? &#x200B;New Boyfriend's Body Image Issues Killed Our First Attempt At Sex...How Can I Help Him Out? About a month ago, I reconnected with and started dating an amazing guy. The relationship is new but it's been fantastic so far--he is so wonderful, caring and supportive. I am very attracted to him on multiple levels--physical, intellectual, emotional. He just checks so many boxes for me! The trouble is that I think he suffers from some self-esteem issues. Prior to meeting me, he hadn't been in a serious relationship for several years. He spent the last few years depressed, going on various misadventures via online dating and perhaps drinking a little too much. He told me that at one point he had just given up on the idea of finding anyone. In the week prior to our first time having sex together, we were ramping each other up like crazy with some really amazing sexting. I was really, REALLY looking forward to being with him intimately for the first time. But then something happened. As soon as he took his clothes off, he started to seem really nervous. Then he told me not to look at his body. I asked him why and he said it was because he felt like it wasn't \"good enough\" for me. I started to pull out my regular bag of tricks but he could not get hard. I was shocked and kind of confused. He told me that he was attracted to me but got performance anxiety because I am so much \"sexier\" than he is. He kept apologizing and saying that it wasn't the first time it had happened to him either. He was able to get it up on a later attempt, but the first instance still stayed in my mind. He is always commenting on how attractive I am and how he doesn't feel like he can measure up. He told me that he wants to ditch his glasses for contacts so that he can \"look good\" for me. He is telling me that he needs to work out more so he can look better, how he needs to dress better, etc, etc. I keep telling him that I'm all for self-improvement but that he really does not need to make any adjustments at all to impress me. I like him just the way he is, but I can't help but think that he is dealing with some low self-esteem. Is there any way that I can help this guy out other than to verbally reassure him?My New Boyfriend Is Kinky And I've Been Vanilla Up To This Point...Help? I've been with an amazing new guy for a few weeks now. He checks all the boxes for me. Our chemistry is incredible. But tonight I discovered that he also has a bag of kinky toys that he keeps in his room. I've never been kinky. This isn't because I don't want to be, it's just that I've never had a partner who was. I asked him if it's okay that I've never done that and he assured me that he was. He said he just wanted to have the kind of sex that made us both satisfied and happy. He also said that he was crazy about me and that he had done enough kinky stuff in his past to never feel like he missed out on anything anyways. The thing is...his tenderness and acceptance of me turned me on even more and now he's got me very curious about his toys. He used bondage tape to tie my wrists together tonight and that alone sent chills up and down my spine. It was super exciting and now I want to take things a step further. Any advice for someone who is completely new to kink? I feel like I am having a second sexual awakening with him. I'm not doing it to please him alone but am genuinely intrigued to explore. But I don't know where to start! Any advice? &#x200B;If I Can Do It, So Can You! I was in a relationship with a pwBPD for six years. The history of our time together is basically just a very long history of him abusing me. Things ended when he dumped me for a new \"favorite person\"--his ex. He was the man I thought I would marry and have a baby with. Right now I am sitting in the kitchen with my new boyfriend. He is by all accounts \"normal.\" There's no rage. No impatience. He isn't impulsive or moody. He ended his previous relationships for normal reasons. He's on good terms with his family. I can talk to him about mature things. He's a history buff. I always knew that I could do better and now I'm happy to say that I truly am doing better. If I can do it, you can do it too. You can find the strength to leave. You can find what you deserve. I started over and it's one of the best decisions I ever made. You can do it too!To Valentine or Not Valentine. We are both 29. I started talking to a guy about three weeks ago. We had an amazing first date. Sparks were flying like the Fourth of July. I felt like I was in a movie. We did not have sex but it was passionate and romantic and unbelievable. We had an amazing second date. Went out to dinner and then got caught in a rainstorm and started making out like crazy. I didn't plan to spend the night because I was on my period but then I caved because he said he just wanted to be close to me, even if we weren't going to be intimate. Spent the entire night embracing and talking for hours. He asked really deep questions and bared his soul to me. He told me he wanted to know everything about me. Despite the fact he's working 70+ hours a week, we communicate for about an hour each day. He really wants to know what makes me tick. Everything about us seems so easy so far. I know it seems early but we're already talking about all kinds of future dates. It will be about a month when Valentine's Day hits. Is it too soon to celebrate? Does doing that make it seem like something more than what it might be? I was thinking of writing him a love note and getting him a small, inexpensive gift. What do you think?!I've Never Felt Equal In A Relationship Before...This Thing Is Freaking Me Out Long story short, I was in an abusive relationship with a mentally ill person for 6 years. Things ended in December. I spent the majority of that time taking care of him. Financially, physically, emotionally. If it was a pie chart, I would say that I was doing 80-90% of the work while he did 10-20%. He was like a baby in a grown man's body that I had to caretake for. I'm dating a new guy and our relationship is just very...equal. He isn't selfish or overbearing. We order a pizza and he eats exactly half. He reciprocates emotionally. He puts in equal time. He tells me about himself and he wants to know about me. When we're in bed, he wants me to feel as satisfied as he does. It's...WEIRD. After being a caretaker to an abusive person for so long, I almost don't know how to react. I have never been treated so sweetly by anyone in my life. Has anyone ever experienced this? Should I go to therapy or something? I know that I can be in this relationship, it is just hard for me to wrap my head around it sometimes.Things That Instantly Turn Me Off When I'm Getting To Know A Guy **A guy who is way too eager to be agreeable to everything I say** You like baseball? I like baseball! You like tacos? I like tacos! You like obscure works of postmodern Russian literature? No way, me too! **A guy who responds to several questions I ask by just saying, \"I don't know.\"** Once might be acceptable...but if you are saying \"I don't know\" 4-5 times in one conversation...it's not good. **A guy who wears his insecurities on his sleeve.** Yes, it's one thing to be open and vulnerable to some extent. It's another thing to tell me that you look forward to breakups because of all the weight that you lose as a result of the subsequent depression...hmm. Not an attractive thing to say. **A guy who does not know when to stop trolling.** It's okay to tease and to have a sense of humor. But please know when to turn that off too. If you seem to have no sense of what's appropriately funny and what isn't, that comes off as hugely immature. **A guy who cannot take a hint.** If I give you three consecutive indications that I do not want to hang out with you, please do not assume that I am playing hard to get. I am trying to tell you that the answer is no. A fourth invitation is not appropriate.How To Get Ghosted This post might get downvoted, but...this is how you get ghosted, in my opinion. Day 1: Me: Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I had fun going out with you last night but things are getting serious between me and another guy I'm seeing so I think it's best if we stop seeing each other. I hope you find what you're looking for. Guy: Oh, I understand. No worries! Day 2: Guy: So, how did your date go with the other guy? How was the sushi? Me: Sorry, but I think it's best if we just keep my personal life out of it at this point. Best of luck to you. Guy: FYI...I like sushi too! Day 3: Guy: So how's your day going? Guy: \\[sends picture of drinks he's having at 12 AM\\] Hope you're having a great weekend! &#x200B; RESULT: GHOSTED. &#x200B;I [29/F] Told My Co-worker [35/M] I Wasn't Interest In Romance And The Next Day He's Texting Me Again Long story short: I broke up with my long-term boyfriend 6 weeks ago and started flirting with my coworker. Nothing serious, just some very general flirtation. Now I've come to my senses, realized I was in \"rebound\" mode and am aware that I definitely do not want to pursue anything romantic with him. He asked me out for a beer last night and I obliged, if only to set the record straight. So last night I met up with him to have one drink and to tell him, very clear and straightforward, that I did not want to pursue anything romantic. He played dumb, and told me that he had no idea I was flirting with him. Well, I thought, you didn't think I was flirting with you and yet you invited me out for a drink. Hmm. But he seemed to understand it. We talked about some work related things and I made it abundantly clear that I did not want to pursue romance because I don't do workplace romance. He said he understood. Today he starts texting me, trying to make \"small talk.\" He says we should go out again sometime and I say sure, in a group with other coworkers. He mentions the gym and starts asking me when I go to the gym and what time and basically just tries to dig up some way for us to hang out again. So I reiterated: I want to keep personal life and professional life separate. What should I do? Was I wrong to meet up with him at all? I thought it would be better to just tell him to his face in a place that wasn't at work. :/How Soon Is Too Soon To Hand Out \"Dear John\" Letters? I've been single and mingling for almost two months now. I've been entertaining multiple offers, chatting with and meeting up with multiple guys...as is normal for people in this day and age I suppose. The problem is...I had an AMAZING first date last weekend and I'm totally crazy about him. It's just a feeling and it might sound stupid, but I think he is that into me too. I can't think of anybody but him. We were making out like crazy on our first date and planning all kinds of future dates and then when I dropped him off at the place where his parents live, he asked if I wanted to come in and meet them. I suppose it isn't \\*that\\* weird because we've known each other since high school but things just took a very romantic turn. I know it seems so soon but it just feels so real. So... How soon should I tell these other guys that I've been talking to and seeing? I don't want to lead anyone on. I know it's risky to drop everyone else just like that but I can't think of anyone but him. Advice?He's Busy And I'm Pretending To Be Cool About It Because Of What My Ex Said To Me I ended a very toxic relationship about six weeks ago. My ex had cheated on me and I made the foolish mistake of calling the girl he cheated on me with and telling her that 1. my ex was still dating me and 2. my ex had anger problems. I was just trying to warn her. He, predictably, was incensed by this. \"I can't believe you called her, that is such a violation of my privacy!\" He screamed. \"What if I called the next guy that you're gonna date and told him that you're clingy?!?!\" I reconnected with a great guy recently. The problem is that he works insane hours--like 8 AM to 8 PM every day. I have accepted this and am trying to take it slow and not be obsessive. I am afraid to call him and text him every day because of what my ex said...I really don't want to be so clingy. Yesterday I thought he would text me but he didn't. I want to give him enough space though, so I am trying to be patient. It's so hard though. \\*Sigh\\* &#x200B;What Should I [F/29] Do About My Co-Worker [M/32] That I Was Flirting With Post Breakup? A few months before me and my boyfriend (with whom I was with for 6 years) broke up, I noticed that one of my coworkers was being very flirty with me. I appreciated the flattery but since I was in a relationship, I didn't act on it. After we broke up, however, I was in a very weird place emotionally and I started flirting back. I went from being a casual acquaintance to talking to him more intimately than anyone else I work with. I blame it on a \"rebound\" frame of mind. But I didn't do anything too ridiculous--I just was flirting as hard as he was flirting with me. Some time has passed and I feel more level-headed now, but I think I may have started something that I shouldn't have. I passed my coworker in the parking lot yesterday. We had planned to work together on a project and he told me that I should add him on Facebook. Added him on Facebook and then he texted me his number. Then he texted me a picture of a beer and asked if I wanted to grab one with him. I told him I was going to the gym and then he said he needed someone to \"spot\" him and that we should go together. Dude is not just thirsty--seems like he is dying of thirst! What should I do? I know that dating coworkers is a terrible idea. I've done it before and it always ends up a completely shitshow. Should I meet him outside of work and have an honest discussion with him? I do not want to lead him on or create a potentially awkward situation at work. I don't think he's a creep or will take it the wrong way--I think he's level-headed enough to see where I'm coming from. TLDR: flirted with co-worker and now have come to my senses...wondering what is the best step to take now?Buyer Upset About Item, Won't Go For Refund, Threatening Neg A couple weeks ago, I had an inexpensive coat on sale on eBay. I accepted the buyer's Best Offer at a good discount. Today I open my messages and see a long, rambling rant about how angry the buyer is because the coat looks lighter in person as compared to the photo they saw in the description. While the coat may be a tiny bit lighter in \"real life\", I don't think the photo was a misrepresentation of what it looks like. I politely apologize and remind the buyer that they can send the item back for a refund within 30 days. They send me another long, rambling rant about how the cost of shipping is almost as much as the item itself and how it's a waste of their precious time to return it and that they are DEFINITELY going to give me negative feedback for this terrible insult. If they do leave negative feedback, is this something that could be reviewed or potentially removed by eBay? Or should I just chalk this one up as a loss and forget about it? Thanks. &#x200B;How To Deal With Co-Worker Who Is A Magnet For Drama? I like my co-worker. I think she is a good person. But good lord, that woman is SO dramatic. Everything that happens to her--and I mean EVERYTHING--is a catastrophe. A disaster. An emergency. It's to the point where I don't want to interact with her because I have enough on my plate and I can't handle my own work responsibilities much less all that hysteria. I also ended an abusive relationship late last year and people who are over-the-top now give me a wave of PTSD. I had poor boundaries last year and let this co-worker call me outside of work hours to discuss \"issues\" at our site. She tried to do it twice in a week recently and that's when I had to re-establish my boundaries and let her know that I need to attend to my own matters when work is over. No more answering calls related to work at 9 PM for me. Any other tips for dealing with a co-worker who is super over the top?Realization 5 Weeks After Breakup My ex used to say a lot of awful things to me. He said that I didn't know how to flirt, that I didn't know how to \"advertise\" myself, that I didn't have feminine wiles. But I find myself, 5 weeks after my breakup, feeling very flirty, very girly and very feminine. More so than I ever did when I was with him. I've been talking to a guy that I knew in high school and things are heating up. He excites me, he knows what to say to me, and I find myself fighting butterflies every time I see his name pop up on my phone. So maybe...I DO know how to flirt, I DO know how to advertise and I DO have feminine wiles...but for the right guy. Maybe...\\*dun dun dun\\*...I was just not that into my ex. It's weird to think that my greatest fear was once the thought of breaking up with him. Now I can't figure out why I stayed for so long. I don't know what will become of me and this new guy, but I feel like it's definitely worth it to feel passionate about the person you're dating. TLDR: Saying no to one thing is saying yes to something else...and oftentimes, it's saying yes to a BETTER thing.Do You Look At Your ex pwBPDs in a Clinical Way? Post-breakup, it helps for me to look at my ex pwBPD in a clinical way. I mean, it doesn't absolve him of all responsibility for the horrible things that he did to me, but it does help me to reframe it. I think, no, he wasn't angry all the time because he's an awful person, his brain chemistry is just fundamentally different. No, he's not a piece of s\\*\\*\\* for not wanting to be an adult with me, it's just that he has the emotional maturity of a five year old child. I don't bash him too much these days but when the topic comes up, I always think of him in a clinical way. Like the other day, when my former coworker's girlfriend commented on the rude and insensitive time he seemed more concerned about his hunger at the hospital where my relative was going to be taken off life support. I think, well, I wouldn't expect a little kid to be mature in that situation either...they'd probably just want to know where the nearest vending machine was too. Anyone else do this? It helps me a lot to \"detach\" from the trauma of those years.I [29, F] Am Going On A Date With A Guy [29, M] And Am Wondering If It's A Rebound Or Not. About five weeks ago, my long-term boyfriend broke up with me to be with his ex. We were together for 6 years. In November 2017 (approximately 1 year before the breakup), I attended my high school reunion and sparks flew between me and a guy that I hadn't seen in over ten years. We spent the entire night talking like there was no one else in the room. I'm not into cheating and so I told him multiple times that I had a boyfriend. We added each other on Facebook and that was it, though he would frequently \"like\" my posts. Flash forward to last week, when I message him on Facebook to see if he's in our old hometown (we current live/work about 45 minutes away from each other). He said he wasn't but that he would be willing to drive down to my city to come see me this upcoming weekend. I'm really excited to see him but can't help but wonder if this is a rebound, as I just got out of a 6-year relationship. Truth is that my relationship with my ex felt like it was over in July, and just dragged on for months to disastrous effect. After we finally ended things I was crying and emotional for a few days, but in the past few weeks haven't thought too much about him. And I'm REALLY excited to see the guy from my high school. TLDR: Meeting up with a guy that I had been thinking about but never pursued one year before a breakup, is this a rebound or no?Dilemma: Ex pwBPD's Family Member Called Me. Please Advise. I have been no contact with my ex pwBPD for 5+ weeks now. We were together for over 6 years. While he was on bad terms with most people in his family, he did have a decent relationship with his stepmother, who I was also friends with. She is a very classy lady and we shared lots of good memories while I dated my ex--she is far more civilized that he will ever be. Before we broke up, my ex and I had planned a fun afternoon with his stepmom, which was supposed to take place yesterday. In the days before the meet-up, his stepmom was texting both of us about how excited she was to see us both--proof that my ex hadn't told her that we had broken up a month ago. Yesterday, I am assuming that he told her the truth and now today, I get a call from his stepmom. Am I justified in not answering the call and not calling her back? While I had a great relationship with her, anything at ALL that is connnected to my pwBPD gives me seriously ICK feelings. Just seeing the missed call makes me sick to my stomach. I feel like the only way I can be happy is if I avoid anything related to my ex pwBPD, at all costs. Am I justified? I just don't want to call her. I know she's a wonderful person but I can't. I have a date with a non-pwBPD guy this weekend and am excited about it. Calling my ex's stepmom right now just feels like a step in the wrong direction. Is it okay for me to do this? Please advise.I'm Reading A Huge Russian Novel I'm not going to say that my ex was illiterate, but I will say that he was not a particularly well-read individual. As a book nerd who minored in English, this was tough. Not only did he not \"get\" my love of literature, he would make fun of it. He'd demean me about it if he got the chance. One time, I tried to explain the plot of a Shakespeare play to him. He just stared at me blankly. I told him it was important that he listen to me and he just said he didn't care. I really wanted him to get it, so I showed him a Youtube video with a Sparknotes summary. After watching it, he just said, \"Well, there's no way you could have been able to explain it like that.\" Tonight I went to the bookstore and bought a huge Russian novel that I am going to read the shit out of, because now I can do that without someone making fun of me. I feel like a dork but a highly satisfied dork. I love big books and I cannot lie. Now I'm going to curl up in this bed with my book and just have at it. God, I am so glad we broke up!I Feel Like I've Been In A Coma For The Past 6 Years I'm still processing a lot of emotions after ending a relationship with a pwBPD that I dated for 6 years and saw a future with. A lot of those feelings come out in dreams. Many things remind me of him and many things are still \"triggering\" for me. At the same time, I feel strange, as if I've been in a coma for the past six years and just woke up from it. Spending significant amounts of time with non-BPD people is weird. It's been a month since anyone raised their voice to me. A month since I stopped walking on eggshells. A month since I felt like I had to take care of anyone but myself. So. Weird. I am not sure when I will fall in love again but I love the sound of non-BPD men's voices. A lot of them are so kind and sing-songy, I could listen to them all day. My ex always spoke to me in such a harsh, condescending tone. The thought of someone actually listening to what I say is crazy. And I can't help the feeling that some people have been waiting for me to step out of the fog. Maybe they've been there all along. Maybe I haven't met them yet. But I am so excited to meet those people.I'm Going To Ask You Out Tomorrow It's been over a year since we reconnected at our high school reunion. I can't forget the way we talked and talked and talked all night, like there was no one else in the room. Afterwards, all my friends were giving me looks and asking me if something was going on between us. I think we had a strong and powerful connection but I couldn't act on it because I was in a relationship at the time. Well, now I'm single, and I am going to ask you out tomorrow. I've struck out 100% of the time when making the first move on a guy but this is a risk that I'm going to have to take. Every time I'm at a cafe or a restaurant and see a chair in front of me, I wish you were in it. I just want to look into your beautiful blue eyes and know everything that's gone on in your life since we last talked. I hope to God that you're still single, and that you give me a green light. It's been pouring rain the past few days but the torch that I'm holding for you everywhere I go is still burning like crazy. It's time to pull the trigger. Wish me luck!Single Guys Who Travel Solo To Thailand I am a single female who enjoys solo travel. I do it because I love to explore new cities and am pretty independent. This year I noticed a trend--single guys I know who also travel solo. The one place in common that they've all traveled? Thailand. Is it wrong for me to assume that these single guys are traveling to Thailand alone to pay for sex? Or is that a messed up thing to assume? It just seems weird to me because I'm not really the type to hook up with a random stranger on vacation.I Feel Like I'm Playing Russian Roulette Here In November 2017, I reconnected with a acquaintance at my high school reunion and sparks flew. We had not seen each other in 10 years but spent the ENTIRE night talking, as if there was no one else in the room. Problem was that I had a long-term boyfriend and don't believe in cheating. So I told him flat-out that I was in a relationship but that it was great to see him again. He told me that he was single but looking for a relationship. Flash forward to about a month ago (Dec 2018), when I find out that my long-term boyfriend is cheating on me with his HIS ex. So I've been single for about a month. I know that it may seem like a rebound, but it doesn't feel like one to me, as I realize that my relationship with my ex had been going nowhere for a very long time and I never really forgot about what happened at my high school reunion. So I am going to reach out to the guy I reconnected with at my high school reunion. I feel like I'm playing Russian Roulette because there's a chance that he got scooped up by someone else in the past year that I spent with my ex. But it's time to pull the trigger, because I've been waiting for what seems like a very long time. WISH ME LUCK! :)I [29/F] Just Have One Question Regarding My Ex [33/M] About a month ago, I noticed that my boyfriend was acting extremely odd. His usually animated and lively voice was replaced by a dead monotone, as if he were a robot. He stopped calling me by my pet name, referring to me by my first name. I made plans to have dinner with him on a Friday night and then at the last minute, he made plans to play basketball with his friends. I went to his house to wait for him, picked up his iPad (from which you can see iMessage from his phone) and saw the texts from his ex girlfriend. They were flirting up a storm and he was sending her flattering pictures of himself that I had taken during our last vacation. I was like, dude, if you're going to cheat, why not use your own resources/materials? Jesus. When I confronted him, he blew up because I had gone through his texts without him knowing. \"Snooping,\" as he called it. ONE QUESTION: Am I in the wrong for looking through his texts, or is he in the wrong for cheating on me? That is all I want to know.I'll Let You Handle That One My ex pwBPD had a terrible relationship with both of his parents, no siblings and no extended family. The only decent person in his family was his stepmom, who was very polite and would make an effort to be social with us on holidays and special occasions. Me and the ex broke up a month ago but the three of us (me, him, stepmom) had originally planned to spend time together over the upcoming MLK weekend. Stepmom just texted both of us asking if we should get lunch or dinner this weekend. I like his stepmom but I like being NC way better, and feel no obligation to make him seem civilized when he is just a mess. I'm going to let him handle that one, and keep his number blocked on my phone. :)I've Had A Huge Emotional Boner For The Past Six Years I broke up with my ex of six years about a month ago. He was good in bed but deathly afraid of emotional intimacy. Part of that may have been cultural or stemming from a trauma during his childhood, but it was just such a shame to deal with on a daily basis. Making mix tapes that never get listened to. Writing love notes that are never reciprocated. Telling him I'm in love with him and seeing that uncomfortable look of cringe on his face. I just want a guy I can be sweet, sentimental and romantic with. Someone who can not only accept that with appreciation, but also give it back. I just feel like I've been walking around with a huge emotional boner for the past six years.pwBPD Who Isolate From Family When I met my ex, he told me that he had immigrated to the US at the age of 7 and that his parents divorced shortly after. He had no siblings and no extended family in the country. He did not know any of his relatives back in his home country, either. When we started dating, it was very clear that he was on so-so terms with his mother and very bad terms with his father. He couldn't avoid his mother because he lived with her but was very uncomfortable any time we had to spend time with his father, though it was infrequent. As the years went on, his relationship with his father worsened. In the year before we broke up, his father would text him to ask how he was doing, if he wanted to get lunch, etc...but my ex would always turn him down or not respond at all. He also had a stepmother (from his father's second marriage) who was kind and civilized and would invite him over for holidays and get-togethers every few months or so. Towards the end of our relationship, he had also started to ice her out, coming up with excuses for why he couldn't attend Christmas dinner or birthday parties, etc. Did you notice that your pwBPD slowly isolated themselves or painted everyone in their family black? It weirds me out to think of him out there, without family or a serious girlfriend, just wading through life and depending on whoever happens to be in his present circle of \"friends\" to get by...but at the same time, it seems like there is no other way for a person with his condition. He will probably just continue to jump from favorite person to favorite person to favorite person to favorite person.More Thoughts On Media Consumption and BPD So many things make sense to me in retrospect when I think about my pwBPD. Things that he greatly enjoyed and would watch/listen to over and over again: 1) The documentary \"Free Solo,\" in which the first man to free-climb El Capitan says that his \"deep sense of self-loathing\" motivates him. 2) Explosions in the Sky--a band that makes very long, somber, instrumental songs that made him feel emotional but I couldn't listen to because they were WAY too depressing. 3) Nature Boy, the ESPN documentary about Ric Flair. Describes how Richard Fliehr is raised by adoptive parents that he feels greatly at odds with, never feels comfortable in his own skin and then re-creates his persona as a famous wrestler, all while nearly drinking himself to death and bedding hundreds of women. I wouldn't be surprised if Ric Flair is a uBPD. 4) A cover of the song \"Lost\" by Frank Ocean. The song describes a person who is seemingly living a glamorous, fast-paced life but is completely lost in reality. He would sometimes listen to this song 10+ times in a day, wincing and praising its \"deep sense of loss and yearning.\" I never felt that when listening to the song personally. 5) Black Mirror episode \"Callister,\" in which an awkward video game developer who is ostracized and rejected by his co-workers devises a way to trap his co-workers in a virtual simulation and force them to submit to his every sadistic whim and fancy. All of these things make so much sense in retrospect. When paired with the things he hated (feel-good movies, romantic comedies, coming of age stories, period pieces, any plot where the nerdy guy is an underdog but triumphs to get the girl, any comedy with a strong female lead, and generally anything I strongly like) it ALL ADDS UP. I am going to pay closer attention to the media habits of the next guy I date... &#x200B; &#x200B;Everything I Touch Tells Me It Would Be Better Shared With You I reconnected with you at our 10-year high school reunion last fall. The sparks were flying all over the place. We spent the entire night talking--we just kept chatting and chatting and chatting for two hours straight, like no one else was in the room. Afterwards, my friends were asking me if I was close to you and if I had a boyfriend. Truth was that we had not been close and I did have a boyfriend. And I told you that because I'm very upfront about my love life and I don't do cheating. You told me you were single and as we left, I hugged you and wished you the best. Fast forward a year and my boyfriend ends up leaving me for another girl, because apparently he does the cheating thing. I've been single for a month now, spending a lot of time eating alone and sitting in coffee shops alone. I'm not looking for a rebound, but I can't stop thinking about the night when we reconnected at the high school reunion. Every empty chair in front of me reminds me of you and makes me think of you sitting there. Everything I touch tells me it would be better shared with you.My Co-Worker's Presence Alone Makes Me Feel Drunk Context: I just got out of a really shitty relationship that lasted 6 years. Over the past year, shit had really hit the fan. I was thinking about other guys but never acted on it because I don't cheat. He was thinking about other girls, eventually reconnected with an ex, then left me for that ex. One of the guys that I had been thinking about for months was my co-worker. He's pretty cute and he's a flirt. He's got the type of body that I find really attractive. But what I like most about him is his energy--he's really positive, always smiling and joking around. My ex was always angry and depressed and needed to be taken care of, so it was refreshing to be around someone who was lighthearted and goofy for once. Every time my co-worker would flirt with me or touch me lightly, it livened me up. After my ex left me, I became more and more comfortable interacting with my co-worker because hell, I'm single and there are no rules now. Today I was talking to him and he essentially asked me if I got drunk over the weekend. Then I had this realization: My co-worker's presence alone makes me feel a little drunk. His positivity and his smile are so infectious. For this reason, I need to make sure I never, EVER get drunk around him, because if I do, all bets are off. If I ever get drunk with him, I'm sure that I will end up waking up in a strange place in the morning and wondering how I got there. \\#warningtomyfutureself &#x200B;Feeling Extra Triggered After Ending Relationship with pwBPD Before I knew I was dating a pwBPD, a lot of disturbing things didn't phase me. It wasn't until I was able to fully step back and experience a solid month of no contact that I was able to see the relationship for the sideshow that it was. Now I find myself feeling mentally better, but also feeling easily triggered. For example: I do eBay selling for extra money and this morning I received a very long, rambling, grammatically incorrect message from a potential buyer. Just looking at the message--with all its weird capitalizations and jargon--made my hair stand up on end. In 8 years of selling, I had never seen such an unhinged message. It scared the shit out of me. Later, I get a call from one of my co-workers after hours. I had already put in my 8 hours of work for the day and so I figured, hey, it's time to eat dinner and whatever it is, we can discuss it tomorrow. I need to work on developing boundaries and one of those boundaries is not answering calls and emails when the day is done. So I ignore the call and then tonight at 9:00 PM, I see that they are texting me again asking questions. This co-worker of mine is well meaning but is one of the most over-the-top drama magnets I know, and now that I am away from my pwBPD, this co-worker's intensity is really putting me on edge. I am getting really anxious just thinking about opening the texts. Anyone else feel extra triggered post breakup with their pwBPD? I feel like I need to take a bubble bath, make a cup of hot chocolate and watch Mr. Rogers neighborhood to avoid having nightmares tonight LOL. &#x200B;The Importance of Health and Sleep Post-Breakup It's been almost a month since my ex of 6 years cheated on me and dumped me. For a few days I was a complete wreck, but became better and better as the days passed. All day crying became 3-4 times per day crying which became crying every other day, etc...to the point where I would go days and days without crying. I was incredibly lucky to break up just prior to a 2-week hiatus from work. I cannot imagine how I would have dealt with those emotions and the stresses of my intense job. But I think my healing happened much easier because I was able to take care of my health and get good sleep during that time. I hit the gym pretty regularly during those two weeks and got a solid 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Fast forward to my first week back at work. Last night, I was awaked after midnight when one of my housemates came in. My sleep was interrupted, then I tossed and turned and ended up waking up well before my alarm was set to go off. Result: ZOMBIE. I trudged through work, uninspired and disgusted by everything. Numb. Hungry but not in the mood for anything in particular. Flat as a board. The feel-good playlist I had created fell flat. Everything around me looked bleak and disgusting. It had been overcast and raining on and off all day, so I didn't even get in an ounce of sunlight. Then I just started crying in my car. I haven't cried for over a week. I cried for the great unknown, the life we had created, the little rush of endorphins I got when he was kind, the fear of dating apps and my own insecurities about starting over in my late 20's when I thought I should be married by now. While I think my wounds are really fresh and it's normal to have ups and downs like this, I also feel like you can do yourself a favor by really focusing on health and sleep to get yourself through these times. I don't think I would have felt as despondent as I did had I gotten my regular amount of sleep. TLDR: Focus on health and sleep to get you through these troubling times.How To Bring Up Your Relationship with a pwBPD To Non-BPD People How do you discuss your relationship with your pwBPD with others who may be unaffected by those with mental illness? Are you open and upfront about it? Do you specifically tell people that these people are sick? I broke up with my pwBPD and it wasn't until after the relationship that I was able to understand the depth of his disorder. Meanwhile, those around me probably assumed he was a good guy, because he was a doctor and we had been together for 6 years. When people ask me why we broke up, should I actually tell them why? I feel like I should because it's the truth, but on the other hand, there is a pretty big stigma about mental health as well. I'm not sure I would want to tell a potential new boyfriend that my ex-boyfriend was mentally ill. I know that I am working on myself to become the type of person who can be with someone who is mentally healthy...but I also don't want to come off as wacky for having put up with the amount of abuse that I did. I started telling one of my friends and I could tell that they were very overwhelmed with how negative and dramatic the whole situation was. How do you talk about it? &#x200B;Why Did You Stay For So Long? Some of my reasons: 1. Grew up a dysfunctional home where my father was verbally abusive to my mother on an almost daily basis. 2. Cripplingly low self esteem due to being a \"late bloomer\" with no relationship experience throughout high school and college 3. Confusing \"lovebombing\" and unhealthy attachment on the part of my pwBPD for \\*true\\* love after facing years of romantic rejection 4. False hope that when we reached X age or had been dating for X years, that he would change his temperament. 5. Peer pressure to date and settle down, magnified by growing up in \"Facebook\" generation 6. Having no boundaries and very low standards. 7. Succumbing to pwBPD's crying fits on both occasions that I attempted to leave him. 8. False hope that certain milestones or things (getting into grad school, graduating, finding a dream job, paying off debts, buying a new car) would change his temperament 9. Foolishly believing that he would seek therapy 10. Convincing myself that good sex was worth staying in an abusive relationship for. Why did YOU stay for so long?At What Point Do I Bring Up The Fact That I Can Pole Dance? Over the past few months, I've been working on improving myself so that I can re-enter the dating scene with a renewed sense of confidence. One of the things I've been doing is taking pole dancing classes. The classes are really fun, a great workout and do wonders for my self-esteem. And I love being able to dress up in sexy little outfits while I burn calories! Let's say I meet a new guy and things go beyond the first date. At what point would it be okay to mention that I'm really into pole dancing, without sounding like, er, a slut? Thanks.Little Warning Signs...Like Crumbs From A Poison Cake So many little warning signs I ignored: 1. How attached he became early in the relationship. How upset he would get if I said I was busy for the upcoming weekend, even though we had barely started dating and hadn't even discussed what we \"were\" yet. 2. The way he would text someone and get really weird if they didn't text back. It seemed he would rather die than send two texts in a row to someone. 3. How he would ask ME to call his close friends and ask if they wanted to hang out with us, thus excusing him from the possibility of direct rejection. 4. How he seemed to literally steal the personalities of others, becoming their carbon copies overnight. 5. The way he tried to bend time and space so that we could spent just one more night, or one more hour together, or carpool instead of driving separately...I foolishly interpreted this as romantic love when it fact it was a psychological symptom. What little breadcrumbs of dysfunction did you see before you realized the full extent of your BPD person's madness?When You Imagine Your pwBPD Lovebombing Their New FP The night before my pwBPD broke up with me, I saw the texts and pictures that he had sent to his ex. He was being so cute and goofy with her. Just like he was to me in the beginning of our relationship when he came on so strong. The pictures he sent to her were flattering portraits that I had taken of him. That piece of shit couldn't even take his own selfie. At first, it really made my blood boil to think of him lovebombing her after he had discussed the future with me just a week before. But now that it's been three weeks, I've processed a lot of toxic emotions and am slowly coming out of the fog, I start to imagine other things. If she stays with him, for every cute text, there will inevitably be a very angry one. For every lovey-dovey conversation over the phone, there will inevitably be a screaming, frothing-at-the-mouth fit over the phone. For every show of confidence and charm, a display of deep self-loathing that is almost impossible for a healthy mind to comprehend. On the other side of that smile? The way his eyes would bulge and his lips would curl five seconds before he erupted into a full-on freakout. I imagine her sitting shotgun while he drives recklessly and yells at traffic lights and pedestrians. I imagine her waking up to screams as he goes through yet another nervous breakdown in the middle of the night. I imagine her sitting back as he manically inhales two dinners in a single night or tries to convince himself that he needs another phone/iPad/laptop/etc just because he saw an advertisement for the latest phone/iPad/laptop/etc. I imagine her reaction when his eye inevitably gazes to other women, when yet another holiday or anniversary is cancelled due to emotional breakdown and the look on her face when the next object goes flying and smashes into pieces. Or..her reaction when the whole day is turned upside down due to one small inconvenience, when he ceases to perform sexually because he can no longer get out of bed OR fall asleep without masturbating, when he threatens to cancel the entire vacation, when offers of love and sentimentality are met with dead-eyed stares and when he is talking about suicide again... When I think about those things, I don't really mind him being cute and cuddly with her now. After all, it is only a matter of time. Edit: Thank you so much for the gold. I've been on Reddit for a year and I'm so happy to finally get gold :)Therapy For BPD Loved Ones: Psychologist, MFT, LCSW, Etc. HELP! Hi, I am three weeks out of an abusive six-year relationship with a pwBPD and am researching therapy options. What I noticed: 1. Huge abundance of Marriage and Family Therapist (MFTs) 2. Lots of Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs) 3. Few clinical psychologists and most of them are full or have weird hours Should I push really hard or get on a long waitlist for a clinical psychologist? I'm not trying to be pretentious but are MFTs and LCSWs really qualified to address issues of abuse/trauma/PTSD in survivors and do they know anything about personality disorders? Did anyone have any luck with a MFT or LCSW? Any input would be appreciated from those of you who have sought therapy. Thanks!Just Had The Most Amazing Realization About Sex I dated my boyfriend for six years. Because I am a red-blooded female, naturally, I had sexual thoughts about men outside of my relationship while I was with him. It's just natural to have these thoughts. Did I act on those thoughts? No, because I have this fundamental belief that cheating is wrong. I think you should be faithful to your partner through thick and thin. So while the urge was there, I never exchanged numbers with guys or met up with guys because that's just not the type of person I am. A part of me was sad though, because I was like, well, I guess I'll never have sex with anyone but my guy from now on, because we are in it for the long haul. I guess he'll be the last one I have sex with. Fast forward to three weeks ago, when I find out my boyfriend is cheating on me with his ex. He cuts me loose. I pack my bags, say goodbye and cry for days. But then...\\*REALIZATION\\* I am now free to act on my sexual urges because I am single again. Turns out that he will NOT be the last guy I have sex with. There are many more guys out there that I can have sex with now. This doesn't mean I'm going to go on a massive boning spree and expose myself to STDs, but it means that I can have great, wonderful, romantic, thrilling sex with someone other than my shitty cheating ex and die knowing that I did not just have that for the rest of my life from my early 20's until forever. Or maybe that's just #drunk thinking. Edit: Please don't PM me if you are looking for sexts or nudes. I am not THAT drunk. No offense, but even if I was THAT drunk, I probably wouldn't send those anyways unless 1. We had gone on several real-life dates and 2. I was convinced that you were in it for more than just sex. Thanks.Places That Remind You of Them It's been three weeks since I ended an abusive relationship with my ex. We were together for 6 years and he suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder. I am trying to move on with life but so many places remind me of him. I drive through the city where I was born and it reminds me of how I was learning to drive down those streets early in our relationship. I pass by the theater where his graduation ceremony was held. I think of our first date as I pass a restaurant that has since closed down. The whole place just reeks of him. I don't miss he person he was because he was abusive to me. But the memories haunt me. I am mourning the loss of my identity and the future I imagined more than anything else. I miss security of feeling like I had someone who loved me and that things were going well, even when it was pretty obvious that things were utter shit most of the time. Some days are better than others. There are days where I feel optimistic and even think about people I loved in the past and how I will love again in the future. Some days happiness seems in reach, other days it does not. I feel afraid to start over. There is great fear of the unknown for me. A part of me just wants to be in a totally different environment to erase these somewhat traumatic memories. I find a lot of relief when I am around friends and family...being alone just feels weird most of the time. Anyone else feel this way? Or found a way to avoid all these weird, triggering places that remind you of your ex?When With A pwBPD, Every Movie Is Always A Horror Movie The movies and TV shows that a person likes usually says a lot about the person. My pwBPD had very narrow tastes in film and TV and was very close-minded when it came to watching new things. Some things I noticed: 1. If he couldn't stand a character, 9/10 times it was a female character. He hated when female characters became emotional. He hated it when female characters took on the strong characteristics of typical male leads. He hated angsty teenage girls (quote from him: \"If that was my daughter, I would beat the shit out of her.\") He would sometimes stop watching a movie or show altogether if he hated the female actress. Some that he despised included: Pam from the Office, Kimmy from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Amy Poehler from Parks and Rec, Jennifer Lawrence in any movie, Skylar from Breaking Bad, Tina Fey in any capacity, Natalie Portman in anything, Olivia Munn in anything. The only male actor that he obviously hated was Tobey Maguire...LOL. 2. He hated coming of age movies, kids' movies, romantic movies, period pieces, or any movie about relationships, heartbreak or an \"underdog\" type of nerdy guy who was fighting to get the girl. His favorite show to bash was The Big Bang Theory, and his ideology behind hating it was misogynistic: \"Why should these smart guys with PhDs in science have to fight to win over some slutty girl who works as a waitress?\" I tried to explain that having a PhD in science is no guarantee that anyone is going to be attracted to you and that it takes personality for two people to click, but he didn't want to hear any of that. Sometimes if he we were watching a show and it turned romantic/sentimental, he would stop watching it then and there. It seemed to make him deeply uncomfortable. 3. He identified primarily with anti-heroes. He imagined himself to be Walter White, Michael Corleone, Sweeney Todd and Rorschach from Watchmen. While I like those characters too, I never felt like I actually WAS them. He loved those characters and seemed repulsed by nurturing characters, romantic characters or any character that achieved great things but also had a soft side. He just hated soft sides, or anyone who knew how to balance work and play, or accomplishment with personal life. I remember the one time I wanted to go see The Great Gatsby with him in the theaters. He became so angry not because I liked the movie, but because I wanted to see it in the first place. He was just INCENSED at the idea that I thought it would be a good idea just to check out the movie. 4. Not long before we broke up, he was really into a movie called Free Solo. This is a documentary about the first man to \"free climb\" (in other words, mountain climb without ropes or other equipment) at El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. When I watched this movie, the main character mentioned something interesting. He said that he was into death-defying climbing because it helped him to deal with feeling like a \"bottomless pit of self-loathing.\" I could tell that this resonated with my ex and he identified with this man strongly. Then, when the main character's girlfriend (who is a typical good girl, seems to be in love with him, doesn't want him to fall off the mountain and die, wants to settle down with him) appears, my ex starts freaking out in the theater, talking to himself about how she's such a fucking bitch and fuck her this is a great man trying to achieve something great and she just wants to breed him fucking bitch who the fuck does she think she is mumble mumble. It was really disturbing. There were people in the theater and he was saying these things to himself. TLDR: You can tell a lot about a person, particularly a mentally ill person, by their reaction to movies and TV. Often, what bothers a person about a movie or show is what bothers them about themselves. Be aware! &#x200B;The Endless Cycle of Trips Down Memory Lane I know I'm been posting too much on this forum but it's only been a few weeks. It's been therapeutic for me as I await my first therapy appointment. Please hear me out. What was up with my ex pwBPD's obsessive trips down memory lane? Did your pwBPD do the same? First there was the fact that almost every day, he would look up his exes on Facebook. All you had to do was click on the search box to see their names--there were six or seven of them, and even though some of those relationships were 15+ years old, the 33-year old man couldn't help himself. WHAT ARE THEY UP TO?!?! Even if their profiles were blank or hadn't been updated since 2009, it wouldn't stop him from clicking and clicking and clicking. It made me sad to think that most of them probably never had a second thought about him. Second, the time he got extremely high on marijuana and started scrawling the names of his exes on a whiteboard...but backwards. It was like a scene out of The Exorcist. As if I was an idiot and couldn't instantly recognize what he was doing. What kind of sick puppy does that? Just thinking about it really sends a shiver up my spine. Third, there was the naming of inanimate objects. I know that this sounds like total fiction, but it was true: he named bedroom \"comfort\" things after these exes, and would refer to them with glee in front of my face. \"XXX\" was a pillow that he liked to sleep on. \"XXX\" was a pillow he put between his legs. \"XXX\" was his sleep mask. \"XXX\" was a blanket. Then he'd wrap himself in these things and go to sleep. Maybe he was trying to re-create the womb, developing in piles of love and warmth, in hopes of being born as a mentally stable person? I don't know. It's creepy as hell but you could not make this shit up. Thinking about what he's going to name after me is scary and disgusting. Oh God, why? Somebody please pray for me. &#x200B;Do You Ever...? Do you ever have coffee and a chat with a non-BPD person and notice... That they're making eye contact with you and empathizing with your emotions by looking sad when you're saying sad things and happy when you're saying happy things? (As opposed to looking through you or staring off into space?) That they're at ease in the environment, conscientious of those around them and appear generally engaged? (As opposed to being angry that it took 5 minutes to get seated, speaking too loud around others eating quietly, shooting inappropriate glances at attractive people of the opposite sex right in front of you or seem anxious to leave for no apparent reason?) That they are not scrolling through their phone during the conversation? (As opposed to aggressively searching for \"deals\" online and convincing themselves that they should probably buy a $1,000 vacuum because it's a good \"investment\"?) That they are eating their food and drink at the same pace as you? (as opposed to finishing their drink in one sip or inhaling their meal, just to stare at you and aggressively tap their feet for 20 minutes while you finish yours?) That they are generally positive and leave the establishment with a sense of warmth and good cheer (as opposed to telling you that the cafe--which you went to because they liked it the first time--now sucks, and that they shouldn't have ordered the tea, and how mad they are they didn't do A, B or C instead of to go to the cafe with you, and that they're angry because now that they didn't do A, B or C, the entire day is ruined?) Do you ever look at these people who don't have BPD and get really befuddled and think, \"DAMN. I HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH A PERSON WITH BPD FOR SO LONG, NORMAL BEHAVIOR IS JUST SO FOREIGN TO ME.\" Do you ever...? &#x200B; &#x200B;Reframing Infidelity It's been a whirlwind since my 6-year relationship ended three weeks ago as a result of cheating. I have good days and bad days. Mostly good or okay days with bad moments but I tell myself that the bad moments are temporary. I often think about my ex wearing his nice guy mask for the new girl--acting all cute and flirty like he did with me during the short-lived \"honeymoon\" period of our relationship. The pain of this still stings really strongly. A part of me wants to be extremely angry at him, or at her for knowingly getting involved with a guy who was in a relationship. But then I have to reframe that anger: As painful as it is, that incident was the first step in pushing me towards something better. Towards a better version of myself. Towards a partner that would have real love and real respect for me. It's really tough and it's the reason why so many of us put up with so much abuse but it has to be done: you have to protect your health, your happiness and your dreams. I never dreamed of being spoken down to, being made to feel inferior or being the option while my partner sleeps around. For a long time, I had been living under a rock, hoping that things would change. Oftentimes, rotten people never change. So in a way, I should be grateful for what happened. If it didn't, I would probably still be in utter misery every day, being a caretaker to an abusive, unfaithful boyfriend and just \\*wishing\\* that things would turn around some day. And that is no way to live your life. &#x200B;I Don't Miss You You emotionally abused me and cheated on me with your ex to end our six-year relationship. I don't miss you. I miss having a boyfriend, I miss doing \"couples\" things, I miss affection and sex. I don't miss you as a person. I can find another boyfriend, I can do \"couples\" things with someone else, I can get affection and sex from someone else. As long as I never have to deal with you--your anger, your insensitivity, your emptiness, your insecurities, your paranoia, your impulsivity, your lack of empathy, your mood swings, your general cruelty. You are and will always be so ugly on the inside. No, I don't miss that person at all.Unhappy New Year It's been two weeks since my pwBPD cheated on me and kicked me out of his house. After spending the holidays alone, I remembered how we had spent the holidays together the year before. The Christmas season--with its expectations of happiness, gift giving and family gatherings--always sent him into holiday dysmorphia. He \"rage quit\" my cousin's annual Christmas dinner, decided to leave all the present buying and wrapping to me and was generally an angry, depressed nightmare of a human being for the entire month of December. Around this time, his mother bought him a new electric car with a large touchscreen inside. A few weeks after getting this car, he plugged it in to charge, went to run some errands and when he returned, discovered that an error had caused the car to NOT charge. He became incensed and smashed the touchscreen with his fist. We had planned to get out of town that weekend for New Year's. After smashing the touchscreen, he had a nervous breakdown and tried to cancel our plans despite the fact we had already packed suitcases, rented a car and reserved a hotel. I had to beg and plead with him to continue the trip we had payed for. At the hotel, he had nervous breakdown #2. He spent the entire ride down screaming at me, demanding to know why I couldn't see that he was getting angry and why I didn't stop him from smashing the screen. Then he started yelling at me, demanding that I start researching car repair shops despite the fact it was Saturday and a holiday and no car repair shop would be open to accept a call. The next week, we would find out that it would cost over $6,000 to repair the touchscreen. He spent most of the night crying and howling, so angry and depressed and mindfucked that he would not even leave the room to eat dinner. I begged him to eat something but eventually gave up and went out to find pizza for myself. I came back and he had at least stopped screaming and was sitting up. I had brought him a piece of leftover pizza. The highlight of this nightmare of a day was when he finally ate the pizza and was able to sit up without crying, screaming or lashing out at me. That day was just one of many, many days like that for me. So many days of dysfunction and immeasurable emotional trauma. As I sit around alone this year and mourn the death of such a toxic relationship, I can't help but wonder if I've wasted enough of my time and if something, ANYTHING is not a better use of my time and energy than he was for six painful years.How Do You Get Rid of the Fleas? It's been exactly two weeks since I ended a toxic, dysfunctional, 6-year-long relationship with a pwBPD. But the fleas still remain. I still feel a twinge of anguish when I see a long line, or a traffic build up, or a unmade bed. All things that would have sent him into a feverish rage. I still have little mannerisms and catch-phrases in my vocabulary that I picked up from him. I still cringe when I see a girl who resembles the third girl he cheated on me with. A part of me still actually wonders if his twelfth chance at true love (current record: 0-11) is going to be the charm. How do I get rid of the fleas? I do not want to be like him. I know it takes time. But that freak essentially tortured me for six years and I feel like a part of him is embedded in me...\\*barf\\*.pwBPD Constantly Forgetting Things? I know that this is not a direct symptom of BPD, but did anyone notice that their pwBPD was very, very scatterbrained? My ex was a 33-year old man with a doctoral degree, but he could not go ONE DAY without forgetting something significant--namely phone, wallet, keys, iPad, medication pickup, etc. He would leave these important items in parked cars, restaurants, libraries...even in plain sight. It got to the point where I seriously questioned if something was wrong with him. Though I only stayed with him at his mother's house on weekends, I developed a keener sense of the orientation of his living space than he did. Often I could find the things that went missing in a minute or less. Anyone else notice this about their pwBPD? I'm no psychologist but I think it had to do with the fact that he went from 1-10 on the rage scale so easily. When you're 10/10 on the rage scale, it's probably so intense that you lose sense of time and place. So he would get angry, the world would turn upside down and then he'd forget where everything was. Or maybe that's just something that regular people do too? I don't know. &#x200B;I Fucked Up So Bad Two weeks ago, my boyfriend of six years left me for his ex-girlfriend, saying that I no longer excited him and that he still was in love with her. I suppose I am mad that I did not make more efforts to keep him \"enticed\" for lack of a better word. But you know what I am actually, for real, 100% MORE mad about right now? The fact I went out to a fancy steakhouse with my cousin tonight, packed up part of my remaining steak (and potatoes!) to go...then left the doggy bag on the table. I will never drink vodka martinis again. I am going to be so sad tomorrow morning, thinking of that piece of steak I could have had for breakfast. \\*Sob\\* I fucked up so bad. :'(A Day I Will Never Miss Two weeks ago, I ended a 6-year relationship with a man that I thought I would someday marry and have children with. We had been fighting for about a week. During our daily check-in calls, he sounded like a robot--completely devoid of emotion. Instead of calling me by my pet name, he called me by my first name, which felt weird and awkward. When I asked him what was wrong, he kept telling me that nothing was wrong. I found the texts to his ex girlfriend on his iPad when I entered his room that night. I think he purposely put them there so that I would find them and he wouldn't have to confess it to my face. In that moment, I felt that the world was turning upside down. I looked up at the sky and thought, God, if you're there, just give me the strength to endure this moment. Then I left. I literally left his house for six hours and didn't come back until midnight. When I did, he was laying on the couch, unable to sleep in his room. We would end up fighting for six hours straight. We fought and fought and fought until nothing made sense any more. He would say something, I would contradict. I would say something, he would contradict. Then he went full-fury on me: he told me that he didn't love me any more, that I didn't satisfy him, that I was mentally and physically weak, that everything about me made him sick, that he was in love with her, that there was no point in even discussing anything because it was over spilled milk it's done we're just going in a circle you're sick in the head if I'm gonna cheat I'm gonna cheat and if you stay with me it'll be her and if not her then it will be someone else. As I packed my bags the next morning, he looked down at me and said, \"This is what you wanted. We could have stayed friends but you fucked it all up.\" At that point, the bandaid had been completely ripped off. As much as that situation hurt me, I am left with one comforting thought: that I will never, ever have to endure that horrifying day again. And sometimes, that is enough all by itself. I imagine that day as a bright, burning light that hurt my eyes when I looked at it directly. As every day passes, that light stretches a little further from me and becomes a little bit smaller. Eventually it will just look like a circle. Then it will just be a dot. Then it will just be like a star far, far away. Yes, I will recognize that star, but someday it will be so far away, I will barely notice it. I can't wait for that day to come. &#x200B;Breaking Up With pwBPD vs. \"Typical\" Person My entire life, all I wanted was a serious boyfriend. I had poor self-esteem growing up and was a late bloomer, so when I met my pwBPD in my early 20's, I thought I had hit the jackpot. Not only was this charming, charismatic, strong-willed guy in love with me, but he was so willing to be my boyfriend after only a short period of time. During the time we were together, I thought the absolute worst thing in the world would be to lose him. After all, I had seen others go through breakups and not get over them for years. There was my uncle, who went into a deep depression for 10 years or more after his wife died of cancer. There was my cousin, who still pined for a boyfriend she fell in love with in high school. I just did not want to become one of these sad, heartbroken people. So I fought for my relationship, even when the fights became increasingly dirty and uncivilized. I nursed my angry, raging boyfriend to health every time he exploded over a trivial matter. When he spun himself into a depressive fit because his Mom had cooked chicken again and literally needed me to rub his stomach and sing lullabies to him to calm him, I did so without asking. I became a human punching bag. I watched him binge eat, waste tons of money on \"deals\" and drive recklessly while I turned the other cheek. I forgave him for three emotional affairs with other women. I just fought so hard against breaking up with my tormentor. Flash forward six years and he's kicking me out to run into the arms of an ex-girlfriend. I have two choices: pack my bags or violence ensues or the cops probably get involved. I think about the special needs school where I work and my favorite student--a charmingly chubby little girl that I endearingly refer to as Bubble Head. Well, I think--I can get the hell out of here or I can risk jail, loss of my professional license and never seeing Bubble Head ahead. So I packed my bags and left. Two weeks out from that intensely toxic relationship, I feel weird. Not sad, just weird. I always thought that a breakup would be the single worst thing to ever happen to me. After all, who wants to throw 6+ years of their life away? Who wants to re-enter the dating scene when they're in their late 20's? But I really don't feel sad. I don't miss him and his abhorrent treatment of me. I miss the IDEA that I held on to--the idea that there was a man out there who would love me and want to be with me. That idea with him is dead, as it should be. When I look at the Breakup subreddit, it appears that there are many genuinely sad, heartbroken people there. Maybe that's what happens when you lose a person who is capable of receiving and reciprocating love. But what I was dealing with was not that--my ex was just a black hole, sucking up everything in its sight. And for that reason, it does not surprise me to realize that I don't miss him. After six years, I cried for 2-3 days and then I felt almost nothing. If anything, I feel sad to know that he will continue down his path of destruction with very little hope of getting better. &#x200B; &#x200B;Forge New Paths for Yourself It's been two weeks since my boyfriend of 6 years left me for his ex-girlfriend. It's been one of the most difficult transitions of my life. Today I woke up, did some reading, spent time with my little sister, treated myself to a healthy lunch and then a massage. I had a choice to visit the grocery store and the massage place at the mall where my boyfriend and I used to go many, many times, but instead, I chose to check out a new grocery store and a new massage place. It felt really good. I think it's important to forge new paths for yourself as you get out of a long-term relationship, if you can. It's not because you should eradicate memories of them or pretend those things never happened--it's because you should realize that the world is a VERY big place. Open yourself up to new opportunities. There are new experiences and new people to interact with anywhere. Embrace those moments if you can!Healthy/Cheap Recommendations for Commuter Room Situation With No Kitchen Access Hi, I am undergoing a big change in my life and would really appreciate some recommendations for cheap/healthy food in an alternative living situation. I am currently on a work contract until July and am renting a commuter room where I have access to a fridge but not a kitchen. I used to go to my boyfriend's house to do food prep religiously each weekend, cooking big batches of healthy food, putting them in Tupperware containers and storing them in the fridge at the house where I rent a room. However, now that my ex boyfriend has kicked me out of the house, I will no longer be able to do food prep on Sunday. I have a personal-sized plug-in water boiler that I keep in my room and access to a microwave and sink in the break room at my workplace. Outside of food prep, things that have worked in the past for me include: 1. Fresh fruit and granola/energy bar (breakfast) 2. Just-add-water Oatmeal and soups 3. Frozen foods from the healthier grocery stores like Whole Foods and Sprouts...mainly frozen burritos because they are easy to heat and to transport with minimal mess 4. Avocado + canned tuna 5. Almond/sunflower nut butter and bread 6. Healthier fast-food items here and there (baked potato, Power menu from Taco Bell). Any other suggestions for cheap, healthy foods that can be prepared with hot water or occasional microwave use? I would love any recommendations, as I will likely be in this situation for the next 6-7 months. My plan is to find a new job and relocate to an affordable studio apartment by Fall of next year. Thanks!Reintegration Into Civilized Society It's only been about two weeks since I escaped a 6-year relationship with a pwBPD. Last night I went to IKEA with my Mom and my little sister. I patiently strolled through the store without a time limit or any stress as my sister looked for things for her apartment. Then I stood in a line at the IKEA restaurant. I had a nice meal with my family, then something occurred to me: I looked around at the people there--mostly families. A lot of couples with young children. Some grandparents with kids. Small groups of people that looked related and some that did not. No one seemed upset. No one was yelling. People were dealing with small inconveniences--like not knowing what they wanted to order, forgetting a cup or cleaning up their trays-and it was okay. They all recovered from these annoyances without incident. If I were at IKEA with my ex, his experience would have gone something like this: start by complaining that you don't like IKEA. Reluctantly go. Argue about how I \"never\" offer to drive en route to the store (fact: I do offer to drive, but noticed that when I drive, I become a target for constant insults about my driving.) Get incredibly angry at lack of parking and distance needed to walk to get to storefront. Immediately feel paranoid/claustrophobic in the store and ask employee where item is to avoid any wandering/unstructured time. Complain about line at restaurant, despite fact that line moves very fast. Order too much food. Ask me to pay for the food. Inhale food and watch me as I eat my meal at a slow pace. Complain about checkout line and threaten to leave store without buying item, if only to avoid line, which actually moves pretty fast. Convince pwBPD that we came here for a specific item and need to buy it. Let pwBPD sit down on bench while I stand in line to buy item. Complaints about how much time was wasted as we leave store. Complaints about \"cheapness\" of IKEA items and insults about people who would shop there. Bonus: later that night, gets stomachache, tosses and turns all night. Blames my wanting to go to IKEA restaurant for discomfort/indigestion. It's just so weird being around people who are NOT upset 24/7. It's really going to be something to get used to. I really feel like I've been back from a tour in Iraq or a high-security prison and I need to re-learn what it's like to be around civilized people. More importantly, I need to learn why I let it go on for as long as it did. Of course, my own upbringing, insecurity and poor self-esteem contributed to it. We were a perfect match because the intensity of his abuse and manipulation matched my durability as a human punching bag. So I suppose I have two things to learn: how to be around mentally healthy people and how to be one myself.Break Ups Suck Break ups suck. Before I broke up, I thought it would be the worst thing that could ever happen to me. Now that I'm broken up, I realize: Nothing sucks more than being an awful, soul-sucking relationship with a person because you are afraid of being alone. Yes, it's scary to start over. What would be scarier would be to look back on your life and realize you spent that time being a doormat, walking on eggshells or settling for far less than what you deserved. Even worse if you put a ring on that person or had a kid with them. There's nothing more empowering than surviving the apocalypse and knowing what you want out of life. Cheers to that :)Impulsivity In Many Forms My ex boyfriend, who is a pwBPD, hated many things. He hated the house where he lived, the city where he lived, his job, the commute, traffic in general, parking, walking and taking public transportation. He hated both his parents, his former best friend, most co-workers and his classmates in school. He hated the holidays, his own culture/heritage and children. His favorite thing to say to me was, \"I hate my life.\" \"Don't say that,\" I'd say. \"You become your beliefs. If you say that every day, you will really, truly hate your life and I don't want that for you.\" There were times, however, when my boyfriend enjoyed life. When was that? Well, he loved to eat. He wouldn't eat so much as inhale food. He told me that he once got bored and ate an entire pie. His other favorite story was to tell people about the time he ate dinner at two restaurants in one night, back-to-back. Certain snacks--like Kettle Chips and beef jerky--were never things that could be left around, as he would eat them in one sitting. He was very unaware of the concept of sharing food. It's a good thing that he was a personal trainer and had a history of keeping fit, because otherwise he would have been overweight and prone to health problems. He also loved to buy things. When he was feeling down, which was frequently, he would visit Slickdeals.com and look for sales. He would convince himself that he needed things that he didn't. The things were usually expensive. He would get obsessed about buying a $1,000 vacuum, or building a new computer, or get incredibly angry with his laptop/iPad/iPhone and \"rage\" up the courage to put his credit card down and make the purchase for a new one. Despite taking $2,500+ home after loans and paying no money for rent or gas, he had an incredibly hard time saving money. But I liked him when he was buying things because at least that meant he wasn't explosively angry or severely depressed. He also loved other women. He loved to remember his sexual escapades from college (now 15 years ago) and took great pride in the fact that he was able to bed so many women. It didn't matter that each and every one of these messy, non-committal relationships ended up crashing and burning. He just loved the idea that he was seen as a prize and loved to talk about his exes to get a \"rise\" out of me. It made him feel important. Any time there was a stereotypically attractive woman on a TV show, or in a movie, or a Youtube video, he would point it out to me. Then he started making similar comments about his co-workers and classmates. He left me when one of his messy flames from college reached out to him out of the blue. I think the allure of recapturing his sexual prowess gave him meaning in an otherwise dark world. I don't know why these things didn't strike me as red flags earlier on. As I've said, I have my own issues with low-self esteem and was a picture-perfect codependent for a manipulative pwBPD. Just hoping to recognize the signs as I go through my own reflection and self-recovery, as to avoid this kind of situation in my next relationship. &#x200B; &#x200B;Tackling The Hard Things First It's hard to let go when your first serious boyfriend leaves you for another woman. It's even harder when you were together for 6 years and envisioned marriage and a child in the future. Harder yet when you are dealing with your own challenges outside your personal life. That's why I've been tackling the hardest things first. It was hard to go no-contact with you, but it had to be done. It was hard to change your pet name and the little emoji I associated with you to just your first name. But I did it. You called and texted me after and it took all the strength in my body, mind and soul to not pick up the phone, but I didn't pick it up. It was hard to delete the photos of you that I still had in my phone. It was hard to look at photos of our last vacation and have it feel like I was there all alone. But I did it. It was hard to put all the gifts you had bought me over the years into a Goodwill box (well, actually, I am putting those things on eBay because I like money but that's another story haha). But I did it. It was hard to read letters you wrote to me when you loved me. It's hard to remember how you told me you didn't mind going through the ups and downs with me because you wanted me to be with you long-term. Such a hard thing. But I cut those letters up and they went into the trash. I have a lot of work to do for myself if I ever want to pick it up after this loss. The last thing I need to do is hold on to mementos of a relationship with a man who thought so little of me that he left evidence of his cheating in plain sight so that I could stumble upon it myself. But I think the worst thing of all would be to embody this anger and to let it bend me out of shape, as so many relationships bent you out of shape. I will not become twisted and bitter. I still have faith that there are good people out there and that one day, I will look back at this situation and it won't hurt any more.Obsessive, Labyrinthine Explanations To Avoid Blame My ex boyfriend (who is a pwBPD) was not just opposed to blame, but would go to incredibly complex lengths to avoid blame by placing it on me. It didn't matter what the thing was or if it was even worth \"sweating it\"--he'd find a way to explain how it was my fault. Example: \"I forgot to plug in my electric car last night\" (although he was supposedly doing it every night since he bought the car a year ago). Explanation: It's because I wanted to go home last night and you insisted on talking to my classmate at the bar. We got back later than usual and I was so tired and that's why I forgot to do it. You should have just left when I asked you to! Example: \"I have a stomach ache.\" Explanation: It's because you made me drive for an hour to the restaurant and I was super hungry, so I ordered more food than I normally would have! And you always want rice, so I ate sooo much rice and you even knew that it would upset my stomach. I told you not to order that! Example: \"I backed up without looking and rear-ended my next door neighbor.\" Explanation: It's because you had to tell me the story about that kid. If you hadn't been talking to me, I would have looked and not hit the car. It's your fault. Then you sat there as the neighbor approached me. You didn't do shit! Why didn't you get out of the car and try to help me? It was your fault! Anyone else experience something similar with their pwBPD? I'm just glad to be able to call him my ex. &#x200B; &#x200B;I Hope You're Happy I hope you're happy You aren't happier than me ;) &#x200B; Here's to a holiday season without screaming and \"rage-quitting\" get-togethers with family and friends Here's to a Christmas where I don't have to plan/buy/wrap/give ALL the gifts Here's to all the arguments we WON'T have about moving in together after 6 years of dating Here's to the end of boring daily conversations that always center around 1. how much you hate your job 2. how much you hate your commute 3. how much you hate your Mom 4. how much \\[random occurrence\\] ruined your day and 5. how you have no idea how to fix your situation, nor any motivation at all. Here's to me NEVER having to deal with another grown man calling me names, insulting me and making fun of me 90% of the time we are together. Here's to me NEVER having to tell a 33-year-old man that he is too old to be throwing and breaking things, drinking too much and exposing himself in a bar, or complaining about a new car that was paid for by his Mom. Here's to the possibility of a better future for myself. &#x200B; Cheers to that! &#x200B;Fighting The War Against My Own Mind It's been a lot of ups and downs over the past week since my boyfriend kicked me out of his home and ran to his ex girlfriend. We were together for 6 years and I thought I was going to marry him. Mostly I feel good but will experience weird pitfalls too--like today. I've been trying to help my mother move our of our family home and I just feel. SO. TIRED. I know there is so much work ahead for me physically and emotionally and sometimes I wonder if I can do it. As I clean out my closet, I see a card from my ex: \"TO THE BEST GIRLFRIEND IN THE WORLD, YOU BRING JOY AND HAPPINESS TO MY LIFE EVERY DAY AND I FEEL SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU IN MY LIFE.\" What a sick joke. I'm the best girlfriend in the world, but not better than that bitch you dated while she was still dating some other guy in college. She left you back then and I guess it must have felt like the heavens parted when she called you out of the blue 8 years later to tell you she was single again. Best girlfriend in the world, my ass. Seeing shit like that is really discouraging. Like everything that reminded me of him, it immediately went in the trash. I'm on the road to recovery but sometimes I just can't believe that this happened to me.Nesting There is something that I miss about you. We called it \"nesting.\" We used to make our bed a nest. After being single for many years before I met you, I loved the nest. It wasn't so much about sex (though I liked that too) as it was about cuddling. We would cuddle for hours. It was deep cuddling and I loved how soft and smooth your skin was. I loved how strong your limbs were when you held me. I loved to put my arm under your head as we slept. I was so much smaller than you but I loved to be your \"big spoon.\" I loved to press my body against your strong limbs. I loved to grab your spectacular ass. After being single for so many years, I imagine my neuroreceptors opening wide and being flooded with \"cuddle\" hormones every time we did this, which was almost every day, for years. I imagine that the lack of that cuddle hormone creates quite a withdrawal syndrome in me, much like a drug addict who is suddenly shut off from their supply . It's hard to lay here in my bed at night and know that I will never get my fix again. To know that it is just a memory now. To know that no one's body will ever be YOUR body, never smell like your body, never taste like your body. But at the end of the day, my craving for nesting and cuddle hormones gives way to another calling: the desire to have a child with someone who will not abuse and manipulate me on a daily basis. My desire to have a child who is not brought into a world where Daddy curses at Mommy, where Daddy blames Mommy for things that are no one's fault, where Daddy doesn't have the patience to drive, park, walk or take the bus with Mommy, where Daddy is throwing the food that Mommy cooked wrong into the trash, where Daddy is turning over the Christmas tree and ruining Christmas again. I guess you could say that my biological urge to avoid that reality is stronger than my biological urge for nesting.A Comforting Thought Indeed Before me, all your previous relationships crashed and burned. You didn't like to tell about it because I think you were deeply ashamed but I remember some details: the times you threatened suicide when your first girlfriend left you, the time you stalked a girl who wouldn't answer your repeated phone calls, the time a girl cheated on your boyfriend with you and then left you broken when she returned to him, the time you drove 7 hours in the middle of the night to confront a girl who didn't want you. We ended things after six years when the subject of one of your great past love affairs called you out of the blue. I guess the allure of \"closure\" from one of these spectacularly flawed partnerships was like an irresistible drug to you. Maybe you really were a romantic at heart. As I pick up the debris from my own heartbreak, I have a weird but comforting thought: I imagine you running to this girl and she IS the one. I imagine this girl completes you. I see you two falling madly in love, moving in together and getting married. Your Facebook profile--which never displayed any proof of our relationship in six years--is suddenly awash with couples' photos. You guys do an engagement shoot. There's a baby bump announcement. You're smiling and happy--finally, the curse has been broken and you are truly in love. Now, I don't think I imagine this because I am trying to torture myself. Of course I thought that it would be ME in those photos, I thought it would be ME having your baby. But what is the alternative? The alternative is to consider what is more likely--not the picture-perfect wedding, but a return to the abyss for you. What is more likely is the re-occurring fire and the subsequent thud. The screaming and crying, the missed calls, the threats to self-harm, the cops being called, the deep and dark sense of self-loathing when the angel who saved you from your relationship with me becomes the demon...like me. Or like all the girls before me. It's nice to think of a fairytale ending for you, if only to not imagine an alternative that is much more disturbing and yet, much more likely.The Way You Looked At Me I'll never forget the way you looked at me. We had been arguing for 6 hours straight since I saw the texts on your phone. Despite me begging you and pleading with you to stop talking to her until we had figured our relationship out, you had continued to message her. It looked like you were Facetiming her every day. You were being cute and flirty and sending her pictures---something that you used to do with me every day but had stopped in recent weeks. I looked up at those texts and then just looked up at the sky--I didn't know what to think. I thought I was going to self-destruct. I knew I was losing the fight but kept going. There was nothing that I was going to be able to do or say to win your heart back. Maybe a part of me had lost my mind. Maybe a part of me just wanted to go out with a bang. Either way, I screamed and argued and contradicted you until I felt like we were just spinning on some kind of sick amusement park ride. Everything around me became a blur. I thought I was going to vomit. I had literally nothing left in the tank and so I just fell on the bed and my whole body started shaking. My breathing became shallow--it was like I could not breathe a full breath, only little ones. I was gasping for little breaths and my whole body was shaking. I curled into a ball in the bed where you first told me you loved me. Where I lost my virginity to you. Just shaking and crying and trying desperately to get some breaths. You knelt down next to me. \"You're having a panic attack,\" he said. \"Breathe. Just breathe.\" Then you looked at me. I'll never forget the look. It was the look of someone looking not at me, but through me. Your eyes were completely lifeless. Dead. Soulless. It was like looking into the eyes of a goat. Your eyes were like bottomless pits. I know you told me you were struggling with depression and that you felt that you were empty inside. I really should have believed you when you told me that. I'll never forget that dead look in your eyes. &#x200B;When My Ex [33, M] Cheated On Me [29, F], His First Reaction Was Always To Obsessively Protect The Other Woman. Why Did He Do That? My abusive ex boyfriend cheated on me three times during the course of our six-year relationship. The first time was with one of his classmates in graduate school. The second time was with a girl he met in a CPR class. The third and final time was with an ex girlfriend that he dated in college. She had a boyfriend when they hooked up initially, and then she dumped him to go back to her boyfriend. Every time I found out, the following would happen: he would freak and out get obsessed with protecting HER. Suddenly he became the knight in shining armor, protecting his princess. As if I were some kind of psychopath who was going to show up on that girl's door with a bowl of boiling wax and pour it on her or something. For context: I have NO history of ever engaging in any kind of sick, illegal behavior when it comes to relationships. I have never been arrested or been to jail (as he had). I have a clean driving record. I would never do anything even remotely fucked up to him, who deserved the blame, much less any of these women that he cheated on me with. So what was the obsession with protecting them? He always wanted to know if I had their contact info, and if I knew where they lived. As if I would EVER do anything like that. What was up with that anyways?How I'm Doing One Week After He Kicked Me Out It's been a hell of a December for me and a hell of a year in general. On top of breaking up with my boyfriend of six years, I've been faced with so much: the death of a beloved family member, being forced to move out of the family home where I grew up, living/working in a place where cost of living and traffic/congestion increases all the time, just plain shitty luck (car broken into and vandalized, purse/laptop/wallet stolen, etc, etc.) Seriously, 2018: fuck you. But that's besides the point. The main point is that it's been about a week since I found out my abusive long-term boyfriend was cheating on me with his ex. It's been about a week since he told me to pack my bag and get out of his house. This has been my breakup recovery plan so far: 1. NO CONTACT. Seriously. I've felt the pangs--like a recovering drug addict--to pick up that phone and get a fix. Oh, I wanted to so badly, I'd be crying and screaming and shaking. But I did not give in. It's been almost six days of no contact and it's been SO GOOD for my mental health. 2. NO DRINKING AND NO DRUGS. I've never been one to use these things to cover up feelings of sadness or loneliness. My policy has always been to only do those things when you're feeling good and you're in good company. So even in the worst moments of my life, I've stayed 100% sober. One day, when things are settled, I'll pick up the bottle again and have a good time. This is not the time. LOL. 3. BE AROUND GOOD PEOPLE. My ex abused me for six years. It was to the point where when a man would talk to me in a calm, even tone, I'd be confused. I didn't know that someone would speak to me kindly. I thought I only responded to loud sounds and barks. But I noticed that when I did talk to these types of guys, there was a little voice inside of me saying, \"doesn't this feel good? Wouldn't you like this? Someone who talks to you like you're a friend?\" Then I'd have reoccurring dreams where someone would be treating me nicely and I'd wake up very sad. Since the breakup, I've been surrounding myself with good, nice people. Family, friends, co-workers. You need a team of people that are going to build you up. 4. PROCESS YOUR FEELINGS. I've been reaching out a TON on Reddit and to friends since this happened. It feels so good to go through the emotional baggage. It's like cleaning up the debris after a natural disaster. I've been putting my thoughts to paper, reading up about abusive relationships, and am planning to go to therapy. I realize that I was in part responsible for what happened to me. I am not just a victim in this situation. And by recognizing what went wrong, I can prevent it from happening again. 5. HEALTHY HABITS. I'm the type of person who usually can't eat when they're stressed. I've been eating food and looking forward to eating. I signed up for a dance class. Once this dust settles I will pick my butt up and take advantage of that damn Costco gym membership that I pre-payed for. I've been partaking in self-care. I've been looking in the mirror and remembering that I'm not the worst looking girl in the world. I'm paying my bills and taking care of work responsibilities. I started listening to a motivational podcast. 6. RECLAIM YOUR IDENTITY. Remember that you were a person before this relationship and you will be a person afterwards. You are not dead. You have many great, redeeming qualities about you. You are not the insults or the complaints that a very hurt person ascribed to you. It's ridiculously cliche, but true: you can do whatever you put your mind to. If you can imagine a better version of yourself, you can become that. If you can imagine dating someone who is worthy of you, then you can meet that person. Either you let an experience like this build you up or you let it destroy you. Don't let it destroy you! 7. TIME, TIME, TIME. Just give it time.Why I Stayed For So Long I'm trying to figure out why I stayed in an abusive relationship with a pwBPD for six years. These are some of the reasons I've come up with: 1) I grew up in a home where my father verbally abused and mistreated my mother on a daily basis. For this reason, I thought certain abusive behaviors were normal and/or didn't have a healthy relationship modeled to me. 2) I was a late bloomer and did not have a serious relationship in high school or college. After college, I met my pwBPD and was desperate to be with someone and to lose my virginity. I had VERY low self-esteem. This dynamic fostered a codependent relationship. Throughout the relationship and despite many of his abusive behaviors, my biggest fear was always that I would lose him. 3) In graduate school, I failed an internship at a mental health facility due to a bad relationship with my former professor and then-supervisor. Coming out of that experience, I was dismissive of mental health and wary of the potential for mental health workers to help people. While I encountered people with BPD at that facility, they were on the severe end--unable to hold a job, pay bills, take care of their surroundings, etc. It made me think that all BPD was on the severe end and that there was not a spectrum. 4) My pwBPD was very high functioning--he was a personal trainer who took incredible care of his body, had a very good work ethic and eventually was accepted to a doctoral program and later obtained an esteemed position at a hospital. While I knew there must have been something off about a person who got explosively angry at the drop of a hat, only seemed to find enjoyment in impulsively eating, buying things or making sexual comments about other women, who repeatedly told me he felt empty and \"hated his life,\" had a history of unstable relationships and compulsively and illogically blamed me for everything wrong in the world, I minimized the situation. I thought he just needed to take anger management classes. 5) When you think you're in love with someone, you wear rose-colored glasses. You think it's hard times but that you'll get through it. You will unfairly exaggerate their good qualities, even if they are outweighed by bad qualities at a ratio of 1:10. You become addicted to the love hormones that are released when you touch them, hold them, or have sex with them. You give a large portion of your identity to the idea of being with them. You move mountains that you were only meant to climb. This is why I think I stayed for as long as I did. But I think the first step of any recovery is admitting that you have a problem. Then it's just a matter of giving yourself time and making sure you do not fall into the same trap again. &#x200B;As You Carry On With The Girl You Left Me For Dear Ex, I have no interest in ever speaking to you again but let it be known: It's going to be okay. Why? Because I know that deep down in your heart, you never really loved me. You were suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and I was fulfilling a very specific need in your life. Your need to feel accepted. Your need to have someone who was \"attached\" to you, as no one had in the past. Your need for a mother figure to provide you with emotional support. Ultimately, your need for a garbage can, into which you could expel all your pain and suffering. If you loved me, you would have never verbally abused me as much as you did. You would have never put your hands on me. You would have never stomped my cell phone into the ground or threw my laptop. You would have never ridiculed the things that I like. You would have never made it a point to make me feel like shit on a daily basis. Knowing that you never loved me, I cannot justify suffering over you. If that means that I've never really been loved, then so be it. But I would rather clean up this mess you made at the chance that someone out there does than to spend another day feeling imprisoned by your deep and never-ending self-loathing. So have fun with her. I hope she's The One that magically fixes your Borderline Personality Disorder. Whether she does or does not is no longer my problem anyways.Realizing That My Ex Boyfriend Was A pwBPD Post-Breakup I recently ended a 6-year relationship with my first serious boyfriend after I caught him cheating for the third time. I envisioned a future, marriage and kids with this man. He was the first person I ever loved. My world has been upside down for five days after he told me to pack my bags and leave his home. It's such a weird feeling to be dealing with this grief. However, what I've realized after the fact is that he may have been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. Some things about my ex: 1. The one characteristic that I would use to describe him would be angry. He was explosively angry on a consistent basis. Usually about small things. Any little thing could set him off---traffic, forgetting to charge a cell phone, a line at the grocery store, slow wifi, a character in a movie, etc. Sometimes he would be angry for hours, then switch to being a nice guy at the drop of a dime. Then angry again. In some cases, he'd \"rage\" all day long. 2. He was consistently empty. His favorite thing to say to me was that he hated his life. While we were together I saw him through applying to grad school, finishing grad school, job hunting and then eventually, landing a dream job of sorts. He hated every step of the process. He was miserable and stressed each step of the way. After a year of working his dream job, he was telling me that he hated it and regretted everything leading up to that point. 3. Impulsive behavior. He loved to eat, and would inhale large quantities of food in a short period of time. He could eat an entire pie by himself, or dinner twice in a night, or clean off my entire plate if I wasn't looking. He also liked to buy things impulsively---usually electronics or expensive gadgets for himself. He was consistently purchasing things on Amazon and you could tell it was cathartic for him to look for \"deals\" every day. He was also impulsive when it came to other women--he cheated on me three times and was always making sexual comments about other women, even to my face. 4. Abusive behavior. I became his punching bag after a while. He was a sweetheart at the beginning of the relationship but the dynamic quickly turned to mother-son as opposed to girlfriend-boyfriend. He would construct elaborate, illogical ways of thinking in order to blame me for something that was no one's fault at all. My main role became taking care of him. I would sacrifice all my time and energy to keep him happy for a just a few moments before he'd plunge into another emotional episode. It seemed to me that he had no coping mechanisms for stress at all---no ability to let small things go, completely rigid thinking when it came to problems, and there were literally times were he would cry and would put him on the bed like a baby, rubbing circles on his stomach to calm him. 5. Attachment. Throughout the relationship, he became very attached to me. He never wanted me to leave, even if it made sense due to time and logistics. I did illogical things so that I could just spend an extra hour or an extra night with him. I felt uncomfortable doing things with other people if it would take time and attention away from him. Towards the end, he complained that we never spent enough time together, though we were together every weekend for nearly 6 years. Eventually he reconnected with an ex from college and \"fell in love with her.\" She became the angel, the savior that would save him from himself, and I became the demon. So he pushed me out. As he pushed me out, he threatened me and insinuated that I was going to somehow harm his angel. He seemed deathly afraid of this, which was weird because I am not and never have been the type to confront his exes. So I packed my bags because I didn't want to go to jail and now five days of no contact later, here I am! I just wanted to share my story. It's crazy to me that I let this go on for so long but as I said, he was my first relationship and I just didn't know what to expect and I had no boundaries. Hoping to pick it up after this situation and find someone better in the future.It's Only Been Five Days It's only been five days since I went NC, and holy hell, what a difference. My life no longer revolves around this person. He called twice and texted twice and there have been times where I wanted to scream and cry and get my FIX by picking up that phone, but I didn't. So hard after being in constant contact for six years straight. What a glorious concept. I feel like breaking no contact would literally be the same as relapsing after going cold turkey on a highly addictive drug. I have no plans of going down THAT road. &#x200B;The Absolute Mindf*** Of Ending A Long-Term Relationship With Your First Boyfriend/Girlfriend I just recently ended a 6-year relationship with a man that I envisioned a future with. More than missing him as a person, I'm just mindf\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* with the vast uncertainty of my life right now. He was my WORLD. That's not to say that I didn't have a life outside of him---I had family, friends, a good education, great career, interests and hobbies...but he was such a major part of my life. He was the first person I ever loved. He was the person I lost my virginity to. I developed so many close relationships with his family and friends. I was so convinced that we would get married and that we would have children someday. I was going to change jobs so that we could move together after 6 years of dating. The absolute mindf\\*\\*\\* of having those expectations disappear is unlike anything I've experienced in my life. Everything is upside down. I am not sad so much as I am totally confused. I wonder if this is how people feel when a sudden, unexpected death in the family occurs or someone is told that they have a serious disease. It's like life just changed in an instant. Where do I even go from here? I feel like my entire identity is uncertain.The Way Your Relationships Ended Dear Ex, You went all out with your first girlfriend. You guys met freshman year of college. You were Facebook official and talked about getting married and having kids. A few years passed and she lost interest in you. She wanted to break up but you protested and screamed and threatened suicide. After you finally accepted it, you became very, very dark. You stalked her. It took a very long time to get over all the anger and the resentment you felt inside when this very important relationship ended. Then you fell for a girl who was in a relationship. She cheated on her boyfriend with you but eventually, she went back to him and left you. This situation left you scarred and wondering what you did to deserve it. Then you fell for a girl who you could never take home or call a girlfriend, but the sex was unforgettable. It was a very stormy relationship. She eventually left you for another guy and you were so upset that you drove 7 hours in the middle of the night to confront her about it. You didn't even like to tell me the details of this. You got into self-improvement and started learning how to be a \"pick up artist\" after that. You fell for a girl who you met at the coffee shop where you worked. She went to a prestigious university, had professional ambitions and seemed like the type you could bring home to Mom and Dad. So you fell hard. But she didn't want you in the end, left you scarred and you always wondered what you did to deserve it. More online dating after this--mostly hookups. Great sex but little emotional connection. No one could handle your anger issues. No one saw you as a boyfriend with long-term potential. Then you met me. You were my first boyfriend so I saw you as you saw your first girlfriend. I put faith in you. I was willing to move mountains for you. And I put up with your anger, your insults, your darkness. I wanted to be with you long-term and thought this was just what couples went through. For six years I was devoted and faithful to you. Then you got a call from the girl who was in the relationship and returned to her boyfriend. She said she had been going through some old stuff in her basement and saw something that reminded her of you. For whatever reason, this was an epiphany for you and so you left me for her. I don't know what the future holds for you. I just hope that I don't become like you--that is, someone who was scarred by the loss of their first serious relationship and became a dark, broken person after that. All I hope is that I do NOT become you someday. &#x200B;Accepting The Unknown Last week, I finally ended a 6-year abusive relationship with someone who I imagined a future with. He was cheating on me. He wanted to let me down softly but it turned into a marathon of screaming and crying that lasted 6 hours. I thought my body and my soul were just going to give out. The fight ended with me having a panic attack, curling into a fetal position and falling asleep from pure exhaustion. When I woke up, his fake compassion, which he was feigning so that he could feel like the \"good guy\" who took the high road before running back to the girl he cheated on me with, was gone. He had turned into the aggressor again. He told me to pack all my shit and get the fuck out of his house. I did not want to get hit or go to jail, so I got up and packed. I think the hardest part of moving forward is the fear of the unknown. Of not knowing where to start. Not knowing if and when something will happen. If I'll ever be happy again. If anyone will ever love me. If I'm cursed or not. It seems like relationships are easy for some and difficult others. I know people who happily move on from situations that aren't working and people who never move on. I don't know which person I will be. I guess the only thing I can do is be comfortable with not knowing. To accept the unknown. To be here, in this moment, with no expectations to \"fix\" the past or to try to make the future come any sooner. That's really the hardest part. &#x200B;I [29/F] Am Starting Over After An Abusive Relationship. Need Advice. I just got out of an abusive relationship that lasted for six years. While my ex boyfriend did not hit me, he abused me verbally and emotionally on a regular basis. He was my first relationship and I was naive and imagined a future with him. I grew up in a dysfunctional home myself and maybe I thought that it was normal to have your significant other yelling at you every other day, exhibiting explosive anger at the slightest annoyance and cheating on you in plain sight. I really do want to be in a healthy relationship and have a family of my own someday. I really want my future kids to grow up in a functional home with parents who respect each other. I just feel lost now, and as if I wasted a good portion of my life, and am not sure where to go from here. I also go through weird withdrawal-like symptoms where I feel like I miss being with the man who made every effort to grind me into the ground. I don't think I actually miss him so much as the idea that I was in a relationship and the thought that one day I could settle down and have a family. I am going to be 30 soon, so the thought weighs on my mind. I want to seek some therapy for myself, but from what I hear, the hospital system where I have health insurance is undergoing a staffing shortage for mental health workers. Any recommendations on how to find additional support, therapy, or other resources to help me through this? Any other advice for someone who has experienced this, or knows someone who has? Thankfully, I am soon to go on a two-week hiatus from work due to the holidays, so it will provide me some much-needed time to get back in touch with myself.I Got Tired of Being THAT Girl You know THAT girl? THAT girl who has been with her boyfriend for 5+ years and they still haven't even moved in together? THAT girl who stands on the sidelines in silent horror while her boyfriend gets too drunk, starts yelling and acting like an idiot in public? THAT girl whose guy openly talks about other women with no respect for the relationship. THAT girl whose guy cheated and she took him back... Well, that was me. And I don't want to be that WIFE with the husband who can't control his emotions and is causing a scene on the street. And I don't want to be that MOM who is shielding her children and telling them that Daddy is just angry again and that it's going to be okay. I just cannot let that happen, so I am done with being THAT girl.You Were Not Even My Friend, Much Less My Boyfriend Friends don't yell at their friends on an almost daily basis. Friends don't make their friends feel unattractive and insecure. Friends don't make everyday things like driving to work, going to the gym or stopping at the grocery store seem like huge ordeals. Friends don't stomp on their friends' cell phones to prove a point. &#x200B; You were never my friend, much less my boyfriend. Yes, we did \"couples\" things and had sex. However, beyond that, what were we really? You didn't even like me as a PERSON, much less a lover. You are supposed to be your significant other's biggest fan, and I felt like you didn't even know me. I need a REAL man. A man who is there for his woman, builds her up and is willing to put her needs before his sometimes. You are an immature, moody little boy in a man's body. I know I made a mistake in choosing you, but I am SOOOOOOO done with being treated like a piece of shit by you. &#x200B;The Voices In My Head I am in the absolute trenches of heartbreak right now. It really and truly does feel like being a cocaine addict who is suddenly shut off from their supply. I will break down, cry and SCREAM at intervals throughout the day to let go of the searing pain. I think of you, the memory floods my system and I think, \"if only I could call and get a FIX.\" It hurts more than anything I've ever experienced. I went to a dance class tonight to get some exercise and feel better. All I could think of was the girl in the corner who resembled the girl you left me for. I imagined her holding you and you sweet-talking her and suddenly it feels like my hippocampus is throbbing inside my skull, and suddenly my whole body is electrified with pain. I go back to my car and collapse inside, hot tears sliding down my face and my breath getting shallower and shallower as I to think of a life without you. At first, I would let these mild panic attacks undo me. But lately, I've been trying to find a voice to combat them. Whenever I think of what I'm missing and the pain seeps in deep, an aggressive voice comes out of nowhere, yelling, \"Well, what about MY needs?!?!\" \"Do I deserve someone who makes me feel unattractive? Do I deserve someone who is hesitant to talk about any future plans with me? Do I deserve someone who is angry all the time? Do I?\" I hope that voice becomes louder and louder over time. And I hope the answer to those questions is always no.It Makes Me Less Sad To Realize ...you were just not that into me. Sure, we had been dating for 6 years, but the signs were there long before you pulled the plug. You were bickering and nit-picking at me nonstop. You never discussed the future and when I did, you got tense and/or passive aggressive about it. You said I didn't make you feel desirable and you surely did not make me feel attractive. People were making starting to make comments. I think it took me a long time to realize because you were my first love and people always assume that their first serious relationship is going to go the distance. I guess I was naive. I will try to remember what few things worked out between us and make sure to never date another man with anger problems again.Trying To Avoid A Rebound It's been such a miserably long time since I felt happy. My ex boyfriend always treated me like dirt. Everything with him--even the most basic functions of life--was an uphill battle. He never spoke kindly to me. He belittled me, insulted me and stomped on my hopes and dreams. It was to the point where when I would talk to a guy and he communicated to me in a calm, nonaggressive tone, I got really confused--it was like a part of me couldn't understand it. Another part of me probably knew that this was the way that normal people talk, and that what I was dealing with was far, far from normal. In any case, it is tempting to try to put myself out there again to ease the pain. But I feel so, so unready for that. I need to seriously give myself a firm time frame--like 6 months at least--to truly focus on myself, my health, my hobbies, my family and friends, and what I can do to prevent making the same mistake the second time around.I'm An Idiot For years, I desperately wanted a boyfriend but had no luck. Found an abusive boyfriend who controlled and manipulated me. A man with anger problems who once incurred $6,000 in damages to his car with his bare fists. Who had not one, but three emotional affairs with other women. Whose primary modes of communication were 1. complaints and 2. making fun of me. Who made me feel unattractive and inept. Who belittled me, shat on the things I liked and made sure to kill any confidence I might hope to have. After his third emotional affair, he told me to pack my bags and get the fuck out of his house. Now I feel like I am in the midst of a drug addiction withdrawal. My identity is lost. I return to my room to cry and scream. The only conclusion I can come to is that I am an idiot--an idiot for staying as long as I did, an idiot for missing someone who could treat me so cruelly and happily step on my hopes and dreams. I am such an idiot. I think the only way to go from here is to go hard on the no-contact rule and seek some professional therapy.Testing The Waters And Realizing I'm Not Ready To Get My Toes Wet My long-term boyfriend of 6 years and I called it quits over the weekend after I caught him cheating on me with a girl he had a fling with in college. We had been in a downward spiral and it was the last straw. I tried to take action right away and go no-contact. I deleted photos that I had of him on my phone. I got rid of visual reminders, such as mementos and gifts he gave me. I have been posting on this sub and reaching out for emotional support as much as possible. Today I tried talking to one of my co-workers to put myself out there and try to be social. He said he moved to the area with his then-girlfriend but broke up with her about two years ago. Due to my current psychological state, I asked him how long it took to get over her. He said it took about a year. I could tell that this was probably an awkward thing to say. Then he asked me why I was curious. I said that I just wanted to know what other people's experiences had been. As I said this, I could feel a knot forming in the pit of my stomach. If I continued down this path, I would have broken down in tears right in front of him. So I just said, \"Maybe I'll tell you about it some other time.\" I am back at my room, screaming and crying. I felt like I was taking the right steps but just mentioning it tore me apart. I do not miss him. I mourn the loss of my identity and the future I envisioned. He was my first love and as a female re-entering the dating world in my late 20's, I am afraid of what may or may not come. I cannot believe that I would miss a man who abused me, who made every effort to make me feel like shit, who cheated on me, who left me feeling like the most unattractive, disgusting thing in the world. I just realized that until I am comfortable talking about it without feeling like I am going to self-destruct, then I am not ready to move on.Peer Pressure My ex-boyfriend went to a graduate program where people were put into categories---you were either in the \"cool\" group or you were an outcast. I was never a particularly cool person in high school or college but I noticed a few trends amongst this cool group: 1. They liked to drink and get shitfaced. I'm talking black-out drunk, need to be carried outside, miss the entire next day with a hangover drunk. 2. They liked to sleep around. Married people slept around in this \"cool group\", leading to divorce in one case. They cheated with ex partners. When a cool guy broke up with his girlfriend, that girlfriend became fair game for other cool guys to have sex with. 3. They repeatedly talked shit about the outcasts. If you were quiet, you were an outcast. If you weren't particularly good-looking, you were an outcast. My otherwise faithful boyfriend of 6 years, for whatever reason, desperately wanted to be in this cool group I guess. And as he listened to these stories of debauchery and infidelity, he probably thought that the life was exciting and that it was what he needed. Recently we were at a bar with a bunch of cool kids and a few outcasts. I am a quieter person who only drinks for the buzz and was talking to some of these people. Later that night, my boyfriend turns to me and says, \"It's so typical that you would be talking to \\[outcast person.\\]\" I guess that made me an outcast too. I saw the cool kids as a bunch of people in their late 20's/early 30's who didn't want to confront adulthood and were compensating by acting like high school kids. To him, they were living The Life. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised when he jumped at the chance to run to an ex that he hadn't seen since college. He really wanted that lifestyle. He really wanted to be the \"bad boy\" at 33 years old, in debt and still living with his Mom. I guess I'll just have to take my lame, monogamous, goal-oriented loser lifestyle elsewhere.Ex Keeps Calling Since he cheated on me, told me to pack my bags and kicked me to the curb, my ex has been calling and texting. Usually at weird hours. One day it will be 12:00 AM, next it will be 6:00 AM. \"Are you okay?\" \"Are you safe?\" \"I hope you're alright.\" \"Talk to me.\" His biggest complaint during the relationship was that I was too \"attached\" to him. I was too into him. I didn't give him enough space. I was too intrusive. He wanted space and I gave it to him for a week. During that time, he pursued an ex from college who had called him out of the blue. I guess he always held a torch for her because they hooked up while she had a boyfriend and then she eventually went back to him. I guess some people are really into being other people's options. I'm not really into that. I've gone 100% no-contact on him from the moment I pulled out of his driveway. I went from answering every single call and text, showing up on time to everything and being his #1 Rock in this difficult world to ghosting him. If he ever realizes that he made a mistake, and I'm not sure that he ever will, it will be too late. Way, WAY too late. &#x200B;Spent The Night In My Car Thanks To My Ex My ex boyfriend and I used to be semi long-distance. I worked and rented a commuter room about an hour away from the house where he lives with his Mom. My old routine used to be to wake up at an ungodly hour (sometimes prior to 5:00 AM) on Monday morning and start my commute. If I was lucky, it would only take an hour or so. Last week it took a ridiculous 2+ hours. But I did it because I was willing to sacrifice my comfort and sanity to have an extra night in each other's company. I had been making this sacrifice for years. Last week he cheated on me with an ex flame from college. We argued and he told me to pack my bags and get the fuck out of his house. I didn't want to escalate the situation and/or end up in jail and so I just started packing. Last night I decided to stop my shitty habit of getting up before 5:00 AM on Mondays and just drive down to my place on Sunday like a normal person would. It was freezing and raining outside but I figured hey, at least I'll get a good night's sleep. I walk up to the house where I am renting a room, hauling two large bags in the pouring rain, and have a damning realization: the key to the house is missing from my lanyard. In his infinite wisdom, my ex decided to take the key. I'm guessing he thought that he was \"protecting\" himself by taking back the key to HIS house. As if I would be stupid enough to enter his home without telling him first after he kicked me to the curb. Too bad it wasn't the key to his--or should I say his Mom's--house. Like many, many things my ex had done---the idea was okay and the execution was fucking terrible. The last thing I want to do is show up to my house where I am renting a room at 12:00 AM, knocking loudly on the door and telling the kind family I'm renting to that I lost the key to their house. They have small children and it's not the impression I want to make as a tenant. So I decided to sleep in my car. I spent the night in my car and it was FREEZING. I kept tossing and turning. I really should have been keeping a spare blanket in the trunk for emergencies like this. I just can't wait for the day when I wake up and am 100% free and clear of all my ex's shit. I mean ALL of it. All. Of. It. &#x200B;Why Should I Be Mourning This? Why should I be crying my eyes out? Why should my world be upside down? He treated me like TRASH. I was vulnerable because it was my first relationship. I thought he would be my husband some day. I was an idiot. He is probably out somewhere having a great time without me. I am probably far from his mind. To him, I am just another one in a long line of failed relationships. To me, he was everything. But I am not going to die a thousand deaths for someone who cheated on me and made me an option. No way, no how. Our bodies and our minds are given to us only once. Time to get back on track and when the time comes, devote that body and that mind to someone who actually deserves it.It's Gonna Take Time It's going to take time to pick up the pieces after being cheated on. It's hard to wrap your mind around pulling the plug after 6 years. It SUCKS to realize that you can't call them, can't hug them, can't kiss them, can't have sex with them. But you know what? It's a process. And I owe it to myself and to my future partner to cleanse myself of those dirty emotions. When that person enters my life, I want to be 100% ready. I don't want to ragging on my ex to them. Who the hell wants to hear about that? I don't want to be cold and numb and unable to receive that person's love, should they decide to give it to me. Why? I know myself. And I know how much I love men. It's been that way forever. I just can't get enough of them--physically, emotionally, spiritually. And when I do go in, it's all in. I'm not perfect but I know that I can be good to the right kind of man. And when that man comes, I want to be ready to give them my all.I Miss The Love, The Affection and the Sex It really sucks knowing that I do not have someone to hold, someone to share a bed with, someone to kiss and let's be honest...someone to have sex with. A lot of chemicals are released when you do that with people you love and being pulled away from that creates a withdrawal syndrome not unlike a cocaine addict who has been denied their drugs. I understand that. And there have been times when I feel like that cocaine addict and am desperately sniffing the rug for the chance that one particle of that drug fell on the floor. But I also understand that there are other men in the world who can hold me, who can share a bed with me, who can kiss me and who I can have sex with. And when the right time comes, then I will have that in my life again. It may not be overnight. It might not happen for months. And I have to be okay with that. Before I met my ex I was single for YEARS. I'm older and wiser now and I know it will not be years until I have that in my life again. When the time is right, that will come. And I will no longer miss that. But on the other hand, I might NOT have to deal with someone who cheats, someone who cannot talk about the future and someone who puts up a wall whenever issues of romance and sentimentality are introduced. I think I need to just have faith :) &#x200B;I'm Not An Option He wanted to explore possibilities with his ex girlfriend. I could have played it cool, let him realize what he was missing and have him run back to me. But you know what? I don't feel like being someone's option. Look at any strong, loving relationship between people you know---how many of them achieved this by letting one or both parties fuck their ex? None that I know of. I don't feel like living in complete and utter agony as I wonder who he's talking to behind my back. I do not want to imagine him falling for his ex and comparing her to me, and deluding himself into thinking she's the one because he's high on the infatuation hormones. Fuck that. I would rather rip the cord out than die a slow death that way. What if he chooses her anyways? There is nothing that I could do to change his mind.He Told Me To Pack My Shit And I Didn't Want To Go To Jail So I Did We had been arguing all night, from midnight when I walked in until 5:00 AM in the morning. He tried to bargain with me, tried to play the good guy, but I wasn't buying it. I just don't think you can cheat on someone that you dated for years and transition to friendly exes within a week. So I continued to argue. He went out to blow off some steam, then called me and told me to pack my bags and get the fuck out of his house. I'm well educated with a great career and don't need to go to jail, so I did just that. All I kept thinking is that I didn't want things to escalate. I didn't want violence. I didn't want the police involved. So now I am at my parents' house, surrounded by bags of clothes and remnants of a multi-year shit show. I'm just glad I'm not in jail. &#x200B;My [29/F] Long-Term Boyfriend [32/M] Cheated On Me With His Ex-Girlfriend. I'm Really Struggling To Pick Up The Pieces Here. My long-term significant other with whom I envisioned a future recently cheated on me with an ex-girlfriend. She called him out of the blue after 8 years of no contact and he couldn't help but pursue the \"spark\" he felt when he talked to her again. How do I move on? I am at a really low point in my life and this is a huge blow to me. I am really struggling with picking myself up now.I [F/29] Had A Huge Fight With My Boyfriend [M/32] And Now He Is Emotionally Withdrawn About a week ago, my boyfriend and I had a huge fight. He had been battling depression for a few months and things came to a breaking point where we discussed whether or not we wanted to end the relationship. He said he wanted to break up and I was against it. We went back and forth but did not come to any conclusion. We decided to take a break from discussing the relationship and had a relatively normal time together for the few days that followed. We had deeper conversations than usual and it was really nice to stop bickering for a while. We have been in contact over the phone for the past few days but he seems emotionally withdrawn. While we are not arguing, he is not his usual fun self, either. He has been sounding rather flat and says that his friends and co-workers are saying that he just hasn't been himself lately. I do not want to re-open a discussion about the relationship and an ensuring fight but am not sure how to proceed. I care about him and want things to work but have to also accept that he may never feel that same way again. Any advice?Agony That Knows No End My boyfriend suggested that we go on a \"break\" about a week ago. Since then we have been in contact over the phone but have tabled all discussion about the relationship. We both realize that we cannot continue the dynamic of anger and disrespect that had been plaguing us for months as we fought over plans to move in together and whether or not we saw ourselves having children in the future. I am convinced that he has been suffering from serious depression in recent months. I do not typically like to use \"Dr. Google,\" but I couldn't help but notice that he met so many symptoms for depression: 1. Physical symptoms--tossing and turning at night, trouble with digestion, decreased sex drive 2. Anger--nit-picking, becoming irritable at things that wouldn't phase anyone else, road rage, throwing things 3. Social withdrawal--cancelling plans with friends and family, turning down opportunities to go out 4. Risky behavior--when he does decide to go out, drinking too much. Searching for \"deals\" online and making impulsive purchases for things he doesn't really need, texting a girl behind my back (although nothing came of this). I really want him to get help. But in order to do that, I have to remove myself from the situation emotionally and see him more as a person and less as a romantic partner. I have to do my best for him and at the same time, accept that things may not work out and have the strength to spare my OWN mental health in the process. It is easier said than done. I am just grateful for the times that I feel like I can do it while still balancing work responsibilities. At times I am strong, other times I want to cry because it can feel like an agony that knows no end.My [29, F] Boyfriend [32, M] Is Struggling With Depression It's been a very difficult few months with my long-term boyfriend. He's always had anger and depression issues, but now that we're getting older and there is pressure from friends and family for us to settle down or get married, it seems as if those problems are amplified more than ever. For months we argued about moving in together, and about whether or not we wanted kids. It was a endless cycle of bickering. On top of that, he hates the career that he spent the past 3-4 years preparing for. It's just so discouraging to see someone invest so much time in their education just to feel so miserable on the job. I am not ecstatic about my job but I recognize the power it has given me to reach my goals---whether it is to buy a home, travel, retire a little early or start a family of my own. Last weekend he told me that he had been deeply depressed during the week and wanted to break up with me. I was vehemently against it. He then told me that he needed space, which I honored. We have been in contact on the phone but have tabled any discussions about the relationship or promises about the future. Right now we are just trying to \"figure it out.\" Two nights ago, I told him that I did not think he was a bad person and that I was sorry for pressuring him about the future. I told him that if he didn't want to settle down or have kids, then he was in his right to feel that way. He then told me that I hadn't been pressuring him, which is really weird because it's such a blatantly obvious fact. He has since cancelled plans with friends and when he went out with his co-workers last night to bid a colleague farewell, was told by others that he was not being himself. He told me he was feeling severely depressed and did not want to be stuck at his job long-term. I did not press him with any questions about where we stand in the relationship. I care for him, want to be there for him and just don't know where to start. I think he could benefit from some kind of professional help, as these feelings of hopelessness, anger and confusion have been going on for months and are some of the worst I've ever seen. I don't know what our relationship will be in the future, but I'd like to try to help him for as long as I can. Any advice?Just Grateful For The Moments When I Am Not Miserable These days have been rough. Lots of times I just want to break down and cry. The pain usually sets in first thing in the morning. I do not want to go home and be alone in my bed, surrounded by junk in my room that I am too depressed to clean up. I am just grateful for the moments when I do not feel 100% like shit. Like when I am just sitting at the food court, enjoying a cup of water. Or driving in my car and forgetting about it, if only for 10 minutes. In those moments, I just wonder how long it will be before I'm diving headfirst into a stormy sea of troubled emotions again.Pop Music Is The Worst Prior to the break with my boyfriend, I didn't really hear pop music. It was just background noise. Now I hear it and it just gives me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. Despite the cheerful, high-pitched, often-synthesized beats, all I can hear are the lyrics. The lyrics are always like gut-punches to me, \"It's time to let you go...\" \"If I could only turn back the hands of time,\" \"I want to make it up to you,\" \"You are The One for me.\" Etc, etc, etc. It's just so gross. I want to stab myself in the ear when I'm walking through the mall and hear that kind of thing.That Weight On Your Chest In The Morning Yesterday was a good day. I had a few ups and down in the morning but was feeling almost like myself in the late afternoon and evening. It's been a few days since he told me he wants to go on a break. I've tried to be strong but my nervous mind cannot stand it. I hate waking up in the morning with what feels like a weight on my chest. It feels like actual physical pain. The only way I can work through it is knowing that it won't last for a long time. Also, reaching out to people on Reddit helps distract me from the \"dirty\" emotional pain and all the fear and questions.I Am Completely Torn To Pieces My boyfriend wants to take a break, saying that he can't deal with the stress of our lives and the impending pressure of a future together right now. He has become uncharacteristically calm and supportive of me and I can't help but think that he is trying to ease me into the idea of breaking up. He says it's much easier to help me when he sees me outside the context of a relationship. Basically: Distressed girlfriend=guilt and feeling that he has to \"fix\" my problems Distressed friend=sees me more as a person and empathizes with my pain I have been crying hysterically on and off for the past three days. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can barely function at my workplace...yet I do not want to appear as desperate as I feel, because he says that my desperation to be with him is suffocating and by forcing him to be with me, I am in fact driving him away. Don't know what to do. The emotional pain is just so immense--it's as if I can't see anything else. &#x200B; &#x200B;Can't Deal With Break From Boyfriend I should start this post by saying that 2018 has been the most difficult year of my life. Whether it's navigating my highly stressful job, living in a place where traffic and the cost of living is outrageous, dealing with health issues of my own and a recent death in my family or just bad luck (car totaled by uninsured driver, personal items stolen and vandalized), the hits just seem to keep coming and coming. Over the past few months, my long-term boyfriend has been going through a lot of anger and depression. We've been arguing a lot, as he has his own issues and finds it difficult to handle those as well as mine. To make matters worse, we are in our late 20s/early 30s and there is pressure to move in together, settle down and start a family. It is clear that neither of us are in a place to even discuss the future but the peer pressure and comments from other people certainly do not help. We had a huge fight this weekend and he basically told me that we should consider breaking up. I fought tooth and nail against this because as difficult as the relationship has been, it's been one of the few consistent things in my life and I'm really terrified to think how I'd be able to handle everything else going on without my \"rock.\" Despite his flaws, I care about him deeply. What we agreed to is not a breakup but something of a break--a time period to focus not on being boyfriend and girlfriend but on being comfortable with ourselves first. I told him that it was unfair of me to pressure him into a commitment. We have a close friend that gave into his girlfriend's demands for marriage and now they have a baby and are completely and utterly miserable with each other. Neither of us wants to \"bitch\" the other one into seeing the world their way. But at the same time, my boyfriend does not promise that things will work out. He tells me that if our relationship is going to survive, it needs to between two independent people with their own sense of self-worth, and not done because one person is desperate and the other is trying to avoid hurting them. We are still in communication and he has been very supportive. The anger and depression has lessened but he also seems a little removed, as if he is trying to see me as a friend instead of a lover right now. It's all a little scary but at the same time, the anger and depression was just as scary if not worse. As bad as things were recently, I just feel terrified. I find myself breaking down at work and crying in my car for relief. The thought of losing him is so hard to comprehend and yet I do not want to show too much vulnerability, as it will probably signal to him that I am needy, which will push him away further. It is just so difficult to pick yourself up sometimes. &#x200B;Rough 2018, Boyfriend Wants To Break Up and I Am At My Wit's End I should start this post by saying that 2018 has been the most difficult year of my life.

I heard this somewhere else but new consoles are only exciting to people who have lots of money to spend, plus its just annoying to have to shell out more money just to play the latest games they were meant to be played (and to all those PC players, you have to shell out a lot too for the latest graphic cards or whatever) new consoles have lost their charm, it was exciting to see the ps2 move on the the ps3 but i feel like at this point we've mastered game design, you don't have to be a part of a multi million company to make groundbreaking games, we have come so far to what people in the 80s thought we would come to. TL;DR New consoles aren't exciting anymore and we've basically perfected game design edit: grammarJust finished the comics After getting the full set of comics for my birthday I decided to read them finally. I finished them like 20 minutes ago and it was really cool:) My attention span is bad and I haven’t been able to actually read anything in ages but I was able to focus on the comics!!! Really sad it’s over now:( I was surprised at how different the movie and comics were. I really love both of them in different ways. Overall it was cool to see how more expansive the comics were and learn more about the characters in ways that weren’t touched on in the film. I also loved a lot of the breaking of the 4th wall moments in the comics. So glad I decided to read them finally!Lurking (I can’t give multiple flairs so mention of suicide, self harm, and abuse. Not graphic) I’ve struggled with this for awhile but this is the first time writing about it. I’m really ashamed to be writing this. I have a need to lurk on past fp’s. I didn’t realize until recently but it’s at the compulsion level (I have ocd as well). I think I do this to compensate for their absence in my life. When an fp leaves, my attachment to them gets more obsessive. I used to think it was better because I wasn’t talking to them one on one, but with the lurking it evolves into this parasocial relationship via their social media. Every time I do it, it ruins my day and makes me feel suicidal. I think it’s because in a way, the constant abandonment is being reinforced every time I check the socials of someone who has abandoned me. I’m reminded that they aren’t here anymore which brings up an intense feeling of suicide and self harm. All of my fp’s have been abusive towards me which adds an extra layer to all of this. It feels so bad that people you made your entire world did you so dirty and get to just live and continue on and be okay and face no consequences for the shitty ways they treated you. I start to convince myself that because they’re fine, I was really the issue; that I’m toxic and horrible and awful. I don’t know how to stop. Especially since it’s at compulsion level. I just did this today and saw something that really set me off so I’m trying to cope and not do anything. I wish I didn’t have these urges. I wish I could just stop. It always makes me feel so bad.Why I don’t understand why this is happening. I have tried to wrap my brain around it so much so I’ve been over analyzing myself to death. You alluded to some vague issues with your family and money but I don’t know what that means. The last message I got from you stated that you didn’t want to drag me into your problems. But you know I’d do anything for you. You know I want to help. You have let me help before. Why is it so different this time? Why are you shutting me out? I feel guilty. Right before this I asked you to define what we were. You seemed stressed. Maybe with everything going on, that was the breaking point. I didn’t mean to upset you. It just felt weird. We acted like we were dating but we weren’t official. I hated being in that state of purgatory. I’m worried about you. Are you okay? I want more than anything to speak to you. I feel like I’m going crazy without you. The world doesn’t seem as bright. It seems more drained and dull. I don’t know if you’re going to come back. When I think about you never coming back, I get hit with a sadness so deep to my core that I can’t even describe. I’ve been in love before but this is completely different. No matter who I talk to, I can’t help but feel like they aren’t you. No one is you. Everyone tells me that you aren’t good for me. Everyone tells me that this is unfair to me. But I don’t care. I don’t want to let go of you. You said it to me once. You said you would never leave. You said with me, you felt the first real thing of your whole life. Existing without you feels wrong. The only small moment of relief I get is when I lay down at night. I realize that we’re under the same sky. Please come back. Every day without you is painful. I can distract myself but at the end of the day, the facade will fade. I miss you.I feel like I’m just holding my breath until the next bad thing happens How I feel after tonight. Bad stuff in my life keeps happening and I’m always on edge now. I don’t know the last time I was genuinely at peace was. Whether it’s worrying about problems with bf and if he’ll leave me, to school starting up, to severe mental health issues, to fights with my family, I’m extremely anxious and overwhelmed 24/7. I wish everything would just stop and I could catch my breath and chill but that seems highly unlikely. I need some support and advice. How do you deal with life when you feel like the walls are closing in and things get worse and worse? How do you deal with being constantly afraid that you’re going to be abandoned? If you don’t have any tips, maybe just comment something positive and reassuring. Thank you in advance. I appreciate all the help and support I can get because I don’t have much of it irlDeadnamed I’ve had my name legally changed for a year and some time. I’ve gone by my legal name now for awhile. Even people that don’t know me as nb know me as this name. Well, my stepdad called me by my deadname today and my mom didn’t even correct him. It felt like a punch in the gut honestly. I rarely get called that name, except by people that know me before I changed my name and people who know that name and want to spite me by being transphobic. My stepdad is very conservative so I’m pretty sure he did it to spite me. I feel like garbage and my mom doesn’t even care l o lIntense anxiety Lately, my anxiety has been super bad. I sometimes have this issue where I feel like there is tension in my chest and it gets hard to breathe and I feel like if I breathe too hard, I will die and something inside my chest will snap. I’m not the best at describing physical pain, but that generally is what it feels like. While it occurs, I try to breathe very shallowly so that it minimizes that feeling. It only lasts for about a minute or two. Well the other day, it had been 30+ minutes and it wasn’t going away. Something felt seriously wrong. I worried maybe I was having a heart attack which only made me panic more. I called my mom panicking and campus security (I go to college) ended up showing up. From there, they put me in a stretcher and I rode in an ambulance. All this was making my anxiety worse and I was shaking so bad. In addition, I have bad anxiety about medical stuff and hospitals so I was freaking out. They ended up diagnosing me with nonspecific chest pain which one of the causes listed is stress/anxiety. So I’m not sure if it’s that or something else but regardless I’m scared. I don’t want anymore health scares so I’ve been trying to minimize anxiety but it’s hard. We love anxiety so bad it causes potential health issues!!Just Body Dysmorphia Things™️ -Buying everything oversized extremely bc you have no idea what fits you so you always look like a shapeless form -literally having to ask parents/friends if something fits you bc you genuinely can’t tell -is this clothing item tight or does it fit ???

I’m curious if anyone else relates.Listening to Joe's Garage is something I'll never regret. So for context: a few years ago I watched a video that used part of Why Does It Hurt When I Pee in it. Fast forward around six years, it get into my head. I search it up, find the song, and decide to listen to the whole album. Didn't regret it. I'm no musical genius or reviewer or anything, but I can say for certain it's a good album. Also I have now added \"add water, makes its own sauce\" into my vernacular because I just love the sentence that much.[TW, depression(...?), addiction] Serious thing. I'm at a low in terms of mental health, and I cannot take breaks. I'm literally addicted to my phone. Any attempts to take a break from it will just make it worse. I'm very dysphoric, and can't do anything to help it (at least until school ends in 8 days). I can't see my doctor, because I'm too anxious to reach out to her. Whether it be about my mental health or my dysphoria. I just wish it could get better, but nothing will help. It's not that I don't want to do it, it's that I CAN'T do it, because I can't face my anxiety. It gets the best of me, and it feels like I'm stuck in a loop of emotional torment. I haven't had a good day in weeks. I'm not stressed or anything, it just suddenly came on. I was fine one minute, and a broken down heap the next. I've been that way ever since. I just feel like I can't take it anymore. I want it to change, I want it to get better, but I'm powerless to stop it.Wanting to do things you like, despite the fact no amount of learning will help you get better. So, I've always wanted to get into art, but certain circumstances prevent me from actually learning anything. For example, ADHD, depression, and the constant lack of interest that comes with them. I get really into something, only to quickly lose interest and eventually never touch it for months, sometimes years. Combine that with the fact that nothing I learn sticks, and it just doesn't happen. Another thing I have a problem with is (for lack of better terminology) shaky hands. I can't keep a pen/pencil/stylus straight, and everything I draw is wonky. A line looks like a squiggle. Combine that with the fact I can't learn and get better, it feels like it'll never come to fruition. Simply put, art is something I really want to do, and I want to make decent things, but since I can't learn, it feels like I'll never be able to do it, or even come close to the talent everywhere else. It feels like I'm not talented in anything, and doomed to fail in life.Why can't this month go faster? School ends on the 25th (or 26th if I take finals, let's hope not), and it's only the 8th. It feels like it's really close, but it's taking so long. I can't wait for school to end so I can both sleep in and do more feminine stuff often. It's the only source of euphoria I have (even being called my preferred name(s) and pronouns isn't enough to make me feel somewhat good sadly), and it just feels tantalizing that I can't do it right now. 17 more days, and I'll be able to do it. It feels like forever, but the only thing I can do right now is pass time and hope it comes fast.Euphoria, then a lot of dysphoria. So, it's Saturday morning. I woke up rather early today, and my parents weren't up, so I decide \"now's my chance\". I threw together an outfit using my girl clothes, and put it on. It was the best thing I've ever felt. It was like my depression just left my body. I felt like me. Suddenly, my mom gets up, so I quickly take everything off and change into my boy outfit. As soon as I did (closeted, so that was a once in a lifetime opportunity for me), the (for lack of better words) rainstorm in my head started again. It was back. I just wish I could dress that way again...I can't wait any longer. I know, money isn't everything, but when you can barely afford food after rent and bills are over, live in an area without homeless shelters, and can't bring yourself to do \"it\", it's hard to live. I wish I had the courage to end it. I can't wait years to get out of school, move out, get a job, and save up. Everybody I know is living good, rich lives. They get all the opportunity. What do I get? Nothing. Nothing but a false feeling of hope and misery. I just can't anymore. As much as I want to do it, I can't, which means I'm forced to live this life more. I don't need help, because it makes me feel like a beggar, and I feel like I can't leave no matter what I do.Everything has gone to shit. If you haven't noticed, I'm depressed. My parents argue all of the time. My mom almost got arrested yesterday for drinking. My dad is abusive. I have to live in this hellhole for 4 more years. I don't want to become a foster child, because I feel like I'm taking a gamble. Sure, they might be loving, but are they accepting? Do they live in a bigger city with more opportunity, rather than a small town in the worst state? It's all a gamble. I could get better parents, I could get worse parents. I'm at the point where I could just run away.Fuck Reddit. Specifically, the meme subreddits. (r/meme and r/shitposts) I saw TWO posts in a row on my home screen that were full of LGBTQ+phobic stuff. And they were both on meme subreddits. I'm starting to really fucking hate this site. Those subreddits are full of assholes. Oh, and I can't hide from it. It's like when you shut one post up, ten more show up. Kinda shitty web design, Reddit. When I say I don't want to see posts like that, I mean that. Not \"show me more, Reddit, I sure love these posts\".It gets worse every day. Every day, my dysphoria gets worse. I wish I was a girl right now, and that everybody would call me one, but my parents and half of my school are transphobic. I have to wait until I'm 18 to transition fully, and even then I won't be born a girl, I'd still be born a boy, and it would keep grasping at me until I die of old age. I'll never be a girl. I can't wait four more years of this torture. It's too long. I just want to be me, and not a person masquerading as a boy just to \"fit in\" with my family's standards.There really isn't nothing to say here anymore. I feel like if I say stuff, I'll either flair it wrong or put another unnecessary topic (recommendations for things to draw because I'm bored). There seriously isn't too much to talk about here anymore. It's always the same old story. I'm way too afraid of my posts getting removed because I broke a rule. I'm just extremely bored and can't think straight. But if you really do have something for me to draw and/or Photoshop, give me them. I really need something to keep my mind off of this numbing boredom.I am so fucking mad at the community of a game I play. You search up \"LGBTQ\" for levels, and you get fucking hate. All the levels are just \"LGBTQ sucks\", \"LGBTQ quiz\" (which is just the question \"do you support LGBTQ\", and only no will allow you to beat the level). IT MAKES ME SO FUCKING MAD I JUST WANT TO BEAT UP ALL THE HATERS. WHY. WHY MUST YOU HATE US, WE'RE HUMAN TOO. YOU ACT LIKE WE DON'T EXIST. Seriously, I've had enough of their bullshit. Fuck all of the haters. When you're lonely later in life, you'll put two and two together and figure out why. Edit to clarify: the game was in fact Geometry Dash.Late night rant about how come I wasn't born a girl. I wish I was born biologically female. I hate being trans, but it really is the only path that I want to go on. It is pretty much the only way I could choose. Im overweight, ugly, depressed, and I had to leave a popular trans subreddit (r/MtF) because of all of the \"I just started HRT\" posts. They give me so much dysphoria, because not only am I 14 (where I live you have to be 15), but I'm poor as fuck and I will never be able to afford it. I want to leave this shit country and go to Australia or something, where living conditions are better than the United States of Fuck-All, but no, money exists, and as long as I'm in the middle class, I'm fucking poor. I live in a very small suburban town with no jobs within a 20 mile radius, and if there was one, it wouldn't be trans friendly. I wish I'd wake up and realize that it was all a dream, but no. It's fucking reality, and I hate it. All because the gender lottery was rigged to give me the opposite result than I wanted. Note that I could take the DIY route, but it's also expensive, and I'd have a better chance of finding a million dollars in the street than getting results. And I have to wait another year. Quite frankly, I don't have patience. I want to be a girl now, but that will never happen. Just like I'll never be who I really want to be. There is always some sort of roadblock in the way that keeps me from doing what I want.Went to the local store after spraining my ankle (which has since healed). It only kinda-sorta went wrong. I had to run to the local Dollar General (pretty much a dollar store, or pound shop if you're from the UK) as it was raining, but there was a bit of a problem. I was in a hurry (it's going to thunderstorm today, so I had to do it fast, so I dressed fast). Turns out, I didn't wear a bra. And when you have boobs (mine aren't exactly boobs, but more of an effect of male puberty, but I'll take them anyway), it's kinda hard not to hide them when running. Thankfully nobody who goes to my school (I'm not out there) was there, so I didn't have to make up some excuse to stop myself from coming out. So the moral of this story is to wear a bra, especially when running.The hotlines are fucking useless. What good is there calling a few people who's only job, other than talking you out of doing it, is calling the cops? My house is a filthy mess (stuff everywhere, looks like a crime scene), and they want to send police there. All that's gonna do is cause the DHHR (West Virginia's equivalent of Human Services) to come up here and take me to a foster home, where I'll be abused worse than I am here All because I'm too lazy to get my ass up and clean my room. Edit for context: it's impossible to escape. I can run away, the nearest hotel is a half hour away, I can't drive (I'm 14), my relatives hate me, and the only one that actually loves me is two hours away (or a one day walk). I'd still have to go to school too.Stuck in limbo. I've seen all kinds of people say that they have had amazing milestones lately (HRT, SRS, male failing, etc), and by all means congratulations, but I'm kinda stuck at the beginning. I'm out and that's about it. I just don't know what to do. I have a few school bullies (I'm talking the ones that assault you, yet the school does nothing to help), so I'd be pretty much done for. I have a trans masc friend, and I have to watch him everytime he's near the bully, so he doesn't get hurt. In a nutshell, I've started a journey, but I'm stuck at 1%.I can't figure out how to add a death scoreboard for my realm I'm pretty new to commands so I'm kind of unsure what to do, I've been able to add the heading on the sidebar and I'm able to add players in but I don't know how to update the score automatically when someone dies. Do I need to do stuff with redstone and command blocks? And what commands would I need to use? I tried searching it up but for some reason I only found people telling me how to do the first bit with showing the actual board.TIFU by clapping at someone's funeral procession So this evening a bunch of people started going outside, though strange I didn't really think much of it cause our neighbourhood is always kind of weird so I continued doing whatever I was doing. Then I heard bagpipes, and after a while the song stopped playing and I clapped because the song played on the bagpipes was pretty good. But after a bit I heard the bagpipes playing again and saw a person marching down the street with the bagpipes. I thought it was even weirder but I didn't care much until I saw the flippin hearse with the coffin and flowers with a bunch of cars following it and realised what I had done. Everyone heard me clapping. I'm never going outside again. TL;DR: Clapped after song on bagpipes but didn't realise it was for a funeral procession until it was too lateI clapped at someone's funeral procession So some evening a bunch of people started coming outside, I didn't really think much of it so I continued doing whatever.

I'm never going outside again.why am i so paranoid and why am i seeing things i've been experiencing paranoia and seeing things for a while now and i am trying to reach out to my phycyatrist about it. i have a constant feeling that ppl are in my house or watching me or that my friends hate me and are making fun of me behind my back. when i'm walking to school i feel like everyone i see walking near me is following me and is going to kidnap, kill or harrass me. It's terrifying. i'm not currently diognosed with anything but my family has a history of anxiety and depression but my phycyatrist says they don't think i have either of them. I have a greeat sleep scheduale and my stress is on the low side. i was wondering of anyone has any ideas on what could be going on so i can bring it up with a professianal. i'm in my early teens if that helps.before i fell asleep last night my mom saw new scars, traced her fucking finger over them and asked \"are you cutting again\" the FUCK? edit: it pissed me the fuck off you dont just do what you want. i didnt give you fucking permission to touch my personal fucking scars i get you care but just dont jesus christ .,.sorry i'm just seriously pissed edit 2: the scars are on my thighs and they're fairly noticeable, but i still really don't think it gave her the right to touch them. i'm fine with people mentioning my self harm, but PLEASE do not touch them. that's always been my mom's problem. the first time she found out, she touched my fresh cuts (scabbed over, not exactly fresh) and it triggered me more than anything. it's personal, and as she is someone who i know 100% has never dealt in self harm, she doesn't understand, and i get that. but after multiple times of me pleading that she won't touch my cuts/scars i'd at least hope she'd catch on.my paranoia i've been paranoid since i was a little kid, it came with my anxiety. i always used to think there was an alligator in the vent when my dad tucked me in at night when i was like 4, but since then things have gotten bad. i mean, it's been 10 years since my paranoia started. i hear tapping on my window, footsteps when i'm home alone, footsteps when everyone's asleep, whispers when im blasting music in my headphones, and i see shadows. i've been going to therapy for anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts/attempts, etc, but i never brought up my paranoia bc i never thought it would get this bad/i never thought it was bad. but it is, and i dont know how to explain it to people w/o them thinking i'm crazy?How to justify quitting previous job when applying for new jobs? I quit my last job as a computer vision engineer last summer to pursue my own projects, I felt I could take some risk before it's too late. I've mostly focused on trading and generative networks, took online courses during this break. However, now I've decided I'd work as a data scientist or vision engineer and pursue my projects on my free time. During this period I've worked on things that are completely unrelated to jobs I'm applying. How do I explain this to interviewers? It sounds like I may quit whenever I please and employers do not like quitters. I also envision a career where I work for a company for a few years and take breaks in between switching jobs. It does obviously sound bad for employers too, but what are your thoughts? Is it too much to ask for extended holidays as opposed to working for 30 years straight?How to deal with the excitement of a new partner? Hi, I (m29) have been dating my girlfriend (26) for about 4 months now. We've agreed from the beginning that we don't want to limit each other and left the door open for other relationships. Over time we got more emotionally invested but sex became boring. last week we both slept with other people and told each other about it afterwards. Then we had a discussion and told each other we did not get jealous. we both want to explore how non-monogamy works out for us. we even linked our okcupid accounts. So I want to spend time with both the new and primary partners. The trouble is, both of them are really busy and sometimes I need to make a choice. I'm more excited to spend time with the newer partner because sex is better. But at the same time I don't want to lose my primary nor hurt her feelings. Moreover the fact that sex is more enjoyable with someone else makes me question my existing relationship, whether we are a good match. I get uncomfortable because I feel like I'm hiding my thoughts and feelings from both partners, this should not be how polygamy works. Tldr: I want to spend time with both partners but favor the newer partner because sex is better and new is more exciting, but I can't say this out loud and fear that hearing this would hurt my primary and our relationship.How to deal with the excitement of a new partner?

Hello everyone! Any opinions on how to calculate a probabilistic estimate of number of existing cases for a country/city given the data for neighboring countries? I live in a country in which the government is being dishonest. The tests-per-million is about 100s and therefore number of confirmed cases is very low. The government declares this as a success but IMO it's actually way more. They don't declare the location of confirmed cases or any other stats. What's worse is that the people do not get how serious the situation is and they act nonchalantly. It would be great if a simple and convincing model could give estimates on actual cases.What are the worst case scenario for FUE transplant? How to set expectations right? Hi, I \\[M27\\] have been balding (type VI) for about 3 years, my ancestors are also bald. I'm considering having a FUE transplant these days but I've some concerns. I try to think of the worst case (that I dont like the results) then I'll always have the option to do a full shave in that case. So my question is, does it leave scars in the donor and transplanted areas that are visible after shaving? If no scars is visible, then the worst case is shaving it off, which I'm going to do eventually if I do not have a transplant. Second question: what are the chances that my hairline recedes further after the transplant? Third question: my doctor says the donor area will produce more donors after a few years but I dont find it very convincing? is it really possible that new follicules grow?How does low soil pH affect peyote ? My lophophora was in regular soil for about a year (since I bought them when they were 4 years old), and for the past few weeks I noticed that they got shrinked. I'm planning to change the soil mix but I'm not sure if I can come up with a correct mix (I don't want to do more harm) so I decided to go for a commercial 'cactus soil'. The soil that I could find at a nearby storr has a pH of 4-6, however I've read that ideal pH for peyote soil is about 7-8. So would it be okey if I use that low pH soil or should I take the risk and mix my own soil?I love animals, but why do I like to watch them get hurt? Not my everyday account, for obvious reasons. Last night I fell into this rabbit hole (ha) on YouTube watching videos of animals getting hurt. I don’t remember how I got started, but I just kept searching and watching more. A dog getting ran over by a car and crying before dying, the another of the same, then an adult rabbit biting and crippling a baby. Thing is, I love animals. More than humans even. I’m the person at work who wants to catch and release mice and bugs that get inside without killing them. So why do I like seeing animals in pain?I felt the gravity of a situation before it happened. This happened about three and a half years ago. Also, this a repost of this story that I originally put on another sub. The whole school was at a pep rally, and this one was special because it was our last football game of the season, and it's a tradition that the moms of all the senior players do a dance routine, then the players, and then they dance together. As a faculty member is doing announcements and talking about the game, I suddenly get a heavy, hyper-aware feeling. Like I could almost feel the world turning. I feel more in tune with the world than I’ve ever been. After a few moments the feeling passes, and I shrug it off as just my brain being weird. Not five minutes later, the moms have done their dance, and now the senior players are dancing. I look away for a minute, and suddenly everyone is murmuring. I look and one of the players is on the ground convulsing. A seizure. I don't immediately realize this, and for a second I think that they're just hamming it up for the occasion, but then I see all the elementary school kids being herded out of the gym, and the players mom and several teachers rushing to him. We get dismissed back to class early. In light of what happened, there’s no homework. And the guy turned out fine. He went home the same day.I didn't cut myself Sorry if this isn't allowed Today was a mostly good day for my mood. I legitimately don't understand it, I didn't feel like shit today but I decided not to question it. A bit ago I got the urge to cut myself for some reason though, I don't know why. It's been a while since the last time I've done it since my scars are starting to fade again but I got up, got the stuff I use, and then I just didn't. I realized it's a hassle that I hate and I put the stuff away I'm posting this now so I have strangers counting on me now not to give in if/when the urges come backUncle Acid and the Deadbeats is an amazing band live I don't know what I was expecting, I went to the concert in LA tonight on a whim after seeing an ad for it this morning and decided screw it, I love Blood Lust already so it'll be fun to see those songs live. Oh my gosh I can't believe how talented they are, the studio recordings sound so underwhelming now after hearing their songs live. It's not the same without being able to feel the bass deep in my bones and headbanging in a whole crowd of people all experiencing the same thing I *highly* recommend seeing them play live if you ever get the chance to. It was one of the best shows I've seen (up there with Black Sabbath and Iron Maiden)I honestly can't believe I had never really listened to them before I always knew about the Grateful Dead as almost everyone probably does in America since their existence is referenced in a lot of movies and TV shows, or just from the odd logo on a car every now and then. I always liked a lot of different kinds of music but mostly just what my dad showed me growing up, ie metal and some other 60s and 70s rock. However, obviously missing from that was the Grateful Dead simply because he didn't like them, so I had never thought to listen to them. A while ago I decided to listen to a bit and liked some songs from their first studio album, but I didn't venture out much past that besides a couple songs from Europe 72 that didnt stick with me at the time. A couple of days ago, though, I decided it was time to try and expand and listen to more of the Dead. I first listened to American Beauty and Skull & Roses and really liked them, not to the level of being a full on deadhead yet though. It was yesterday when I was reading on where to start with listening to them that I saw a suggestion to listen to One From the Vault. Instantly from the first notes after \"..will you welcome, please, The Grateful Dead,\" I fell in love. I stayed up way too late last night just to hear the entire album from start to finish since I couldn't just turn a masterpiece like that *off*. Today I was reading some more of this subreddit and kept seeing some songs come up a lot, so I put on one that sounded interesting: Terrapin Station. I was mesmerized at the guitar in every different version I've been listening to all day whether it be it's first performance in San Bernardino or a recent recording from Dead & Co. Without a doubt one of the best songs I have ever heard up until now, hell, I even started to tear up a bit from how much I loved the sound And with that, I think I can say I'm a Deadhead. I'm incredibly hyped to listen to more of what the Dead has to offer and am thankful they have such a wide and easily available catalogueHow common is it for books bought from Amazon to be corrupted I bought a manga from Amazon on my kindle after I read the sample. I clicked the thing that said \"buy\" after it finished and when I tried reading it again it'd be slow and crash. I redownloaded the book and even restarted the kindle but the book would always freeze up. I've since requested a refund from Amazon on this book but is this something that happens sometimes or was this just a bug this one time Edit: after reading some random articles and posts it seems it may not have been corrupted after all and it may have been because it had a large file size so I was trying to read it before the kindle finished \"indexing\" it or something. I did check the webpage and yeah it was over 1gb so I can see that. I've already hit refund and it's been removed from my library so not much to do now I guessSo how do I go about doing basic tasks I've had a really bad depressive episode for a fucking while now, idk when or how it started. I get dressed, brush my teeth, and most of the time my hair as well but besides that I struggle to even shower once a week, do my laundry, wash my sheets, or cook myself food. I also find it hard to do most of the things I like like video games, watching movies, or reading but those are less important than the, y'know, basic hygiene shit I struggle to do Fuck I need to find a job too with all of this when I can barely clean myself. I'm a loserI was in some sort of personal 1984 or I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream hell I had a nightmare I ended up in this reform program for teens called Queebimori. I dont know why I was. It was ran by I think the government. Basically this social credit 1984 kinda thing where Big Brother was watching me and I could see a good and bad number go up or down. Every little thing made the bad number go up no matter what I did. It was really hard to make it go down and the good go up. Bad things happened if it went up too high, I can't remember what though. I remember it went up for me using electricity. I got put in a room for a bit where I saw a ranking and saw I was the second to best one as I just joined. There weren't many people on it. This other random kid was there crying constantly. He was the \"worst\" one. He was very obviously injured and broken. He did something \"bad\" and idk how but we knew that they killed his mom. I was sent back to my house having to watch this stuff. I also remember my family had no idea about all of this. There was a picture too by the numbers of me, and it'd change if I did \"bad\" stuff (again idk what) to be of my family showing it'd hurt them. I yelled at it and it said they'd call me. I woke up after that I think one of the bad things was I prayed to Jesus and they didn't like it. I remember another one was enjoying my time with my family by eating with them. I also remember I couldn't run away they knew where I was alwaysI didn't really understand Tetsuo: The Iron Man I thought it was pretty cool but I feel like I'm missing something with it. I see a lot of praise for it with people calling it disturbing or one of the scariest things they've seen and for me I just thought it was fine. A friend I watched it with said it was really painful too with all the metal his body was turning into but I just couldn't feel any of that. The whole weird fight later on was just kinda weird and threw me off too. I feel like maybe I'm not smart enough for this kinda art stuff or I'm spoiled by high budget stuff and can't appreciate these moviesSo I just started listening to OM and holy shit I had been getting more into doom recently after deciding to expand past my mainstays like Sleep and Saint Vitus. I decided to dive right into Advaitic Songs and oh my gosh I love it. I didn't even realize it was some of the same people as Sleep til a friend told me when I was freaking out to him about how good it was I feel like I started listening to doom for the first time again, it's like the mood I get with Sunn O))), Sleep, and random religious music all at once. I love it. Everything about it, the instrumentals, the singing, the religious themes being not overtly negative (a nice change of pace from all the black metal I listen to), the album covers. All of it is amazingCrybaby did not go the direction I thought it would I fucking loved it. From the beginning I thought it was already awesome with it's animation and soundtrack but as it just went on and got more and more fucked up it kept drawing me in. I called Ryo being satan about maybe when he read the Bible in his apartment and saw Revelation, with that latter fact maybe fucking with me more. This is because it made me think the plot was gonna mirror that and have Akira be Saint Michael the Archangel and defeat Satan in the end, but as we all know I was VERY WRONG. Now I'm just sitting here feeling sick from how intense of a ride it all was. 10/10 I'm gonna go read the manga nowFinished the original series and EoE last night. Don't know how I feel Sorry if this doesn't fit too well here. From what I read this seems to be a pretty normal feeling. I really wasn't ready for what Evangelion turned out to be even tho so many people said it was dark and depressing. It was so much more than that. It has to be one of the best pieces of media I've experienced but if I'll be honest here I am not sure I wanna see it again any time soon lol. It was intense, sad, happy, frightening, anxiety inducing, etc. Sometimes all at once. I'm still a bit confused about the endings of both the show and EoE but I think I'm supposed to be as they're kinda weird and surrealist. Good thing I like that kinda thing I guess. Just knew it had something to do with Shinji getting over his depression in the show's ending but how he did it kinda went over my head. EoE was just, I don't even know where to begin. Really was a wild time. All I can do now is listen to Komm Susser Tod and stare at a wall basically. Amazing series I can't believe I hadn't watched it soonerWhat's the deal with punk Both my parents are old punks but I still don't get it no matter how much I read or what they've said to me over the years. How can bands like Dead Kennedys and X both be the same genre yet they don't sound similar? Or are there a lot of subgenres like metal? But the thing is also it always seems like with some bands there's a lot of arguing about what is and isn't punk. To me punk seems less like a genre of music like metal is and more like what music is and isn't punk is more up to people to decide, rather than it being a sound, if that makes sense.I'm having a tough time with Watchmen I'm still pretty early on into the story, only around chapter 2 but I can't help feeling like I'm more confused than I'm supposed to be. There's a lot of names and such that keep coming up but I cant remember if I'm supposed to not know who they are or if they explained it before. I think it's supposed to be slowly explained throughout as they are all already retired but I still can't help but feel like I'm missing a lot I'm not supposed to Am I just being stupid and overthinking it or should I save Watchmen for another time Edit: alright thanks gonna keep reading it. I just needed the affirmation that it's written like this for a reason. Really weren't kidding my calling this a novel it's taking me about as much time to read as one compared to other GNs I've read lolIs teaching really that bad? I've wanted to teach history since middle school and now that I've finished my first semester of college working towards becoming a HS teacher almost everyone I've told (besides my parents and close friends who always told me Id be a great teacher) has said that I shouldn't do that, either I should be a professor instead and I get the vibe from them that they just think I shouldn't be a teacher at all. The only one outside of my best friends and parents that has supported me was my English professor. I know it's an extremely hard job with little pay and all that jazz but I still really want to do it as my career. Even then, I can't help but feel like I should just decide to do something else instead if everyone keeps telling me not to. Sorry if this is stupid it's just a bit weird when everyone else gets all these \"oh cool\" responses for their goals and everyone tries to get me to do something elseWhat do I do in this situation I've applied for multiple jobs and I only got called back by one initially, and I got the job there as a seasonal worker and went in for my first day of training yesterday. This morning I got a call from another place I applied to for a regular part time job to see if I wanted to work there. My problem is I might prefer to work at this second place, but I've already kind of started my job at the first place, so what should I do? If I do want to work at the second place should I just suck it up and continue or should I quit after one day at this place? I've never had a job before so I don't really know what to do in this situationMy friends mean well but man they can be a bit ignorant I decided to tell some of my friends that I'm ace. The first one I told was my best friend and he gave me the standard neutral response of \"oh cool.\" I told his girlfriend who was the one that told me she thought I was asexual, leading me to realizing I am. Same response. I told another good friend of mine over text because he's out of state for college, went well again. Yesterday I told 2 more of my friends when we were hanging out at the pool. I should've seen it coming since they were the ones who always said \"oh that's sad\" whenever I said I didn't want to date. They both went \"oh cool man whatever\" so I thought we were good again but then they both go \"don't worry though, I'm sure you'll find someone eventually.\" I was hurt. I didn't want to tell them, though. I don't think they understand it's a sexual orientation. They probably think it's me \"giving up\" or something even though I've always said I have no interest in dating or anything of the sort. I did straight up say I'm not attracted to anyone but still they don't get it. It's just, dammit I don't want to bring it up again like I'm beating a dead horse but I also want them to understand what I meanThere are a lot of extremely obvious signs looking back But the one that sticks out most for me is probably something that happened a few days before I realized Im ace. I like to write in my spare time every now and then so I decided to write a screenplay and Id try writing something remotely romantic/sexual for once (actually that may be a sign too). Anyway as I was writing two characters kiss each other I wrote in the margins something like \"damn I'm such a prude I feel the same writing anything remotely sexual as I do writing disturbing violence\" You people also got any signs that were so obvious they're funny looking back on?Realized I'm asexual and aromantic all in one weekend Man all this time has been confusing but at least the feeling of it all coming together and making sense when I realized these things is great For being aro I had doubts but a lot of them were I think me being influenced by society's expectations. Other than that I have never felt romantic attraction, can't even tell what romantic attraction is, and I'm pretty much okay with not feeling it in the future so aro seemed to fit. Even if I do end up falling in love in the future it makes sense now so hey! Happiness It's like 2 am I need to sleepWhat are the scariest pieces of media you ever seen? Movies, books, comics, TV series, games, etc. For me, I haven't seen much horror as I've only been really into it for about a year now but my few are: Movie: Threads (1984). A made for TV British film about nuclear war. It goes from showing people's day to day lives as tensions with the USSR rise until the nuclear war. The movie then shows the effect war has on the people. I would say it doesn't hold back but I've read that it's somehow too optimistic in it's depiction. Comic: Uzumaki by Junji Ito. Released from 1998 to 1999, the story follows a teenaged girl and her boyfriend in a small town. The town however, has been cursed by the spiral. It goes through multiple stories of various tragedies and spooky things involving spirals. The story is unique in my opinion, because there isn't a villain or monster, but the concept of a spiral itself is the monster. Game: The Song of Saya/Saya No Uta. A Japanese Lovecraftian psychological horror visual novel originally released in 2003. It's about a man who gets into a car accident that killed his entire family and can now only see the world as gore, and people as weird fleshy abominations. In the hospital, he meets a young girl and falls in love with her. I think this quote from Extra Credits sums up my feelings pretty well, \"I won't get into the topic of what age you should or shouldn't be to play a game, but let's just say I'm not sure I'm old enough to play it\" (Probably the scariest thing out of all my entries here. It's available on Steam) I'm a fan of psychological and Japanese horror as you can see. So, what about you guys?Is it wrong to be \"PC\"? I've always been around people who seem to be as \"anti PC\" as possible. Making racist and homophobic jokes, slurs, \"facts don't care about your feelings\", etc. I've also started college now too and people are telling me about their professors not wanting to tiptoe around people which sounds reasonable but then they tell me about these homophobic jokes they make like it's the funniest thing. Am I being overly sensitive or something, too PC? These things bother me but I know it's how the world is so how can I accept it?I just finished Saya No Uta [Spoilers for all endings] I did all three routes. Actually surprised how short it was being how amazing it is. I first heard of the game through Extra Credits a few years ago but I wasn't able to read it until now with its re-release. From the first second it just hooks you in and it doesn't ever let up throughout the entire story. The only time I found something boring was when I was doing the third ending after the second and some of the text was the same, and that's only because I had just read it. The whole thing was more grotesque than any piece of media I have ever experienced, the cannibalism, mutilation, and sexual abuse actually made me feel legitimately sick multiple times throughout. I thought I was actually going to throw up at some points but that's more me than the story itself I guess. The first ending was probably the worst, even though the ending was the \"best\" depending how you look at it. It doesn't answer anything and I feel it is only there as an escape if you want any ending because you don't want to keep playing it. The second ending I felt was the most like HP Lovecraft's work. Koji and the doctor being successful in defeating Saya and Fuminori felt like a great ending. I liked how it ended with Koji basically losing his sanity and having to deal with it for the rest of his life. I actually thought I would probably like this ending the best until I played the third. I assume the third is the true ending. To be honest, I didn't find myself rooting for Saya and Fuminori throughout the story too much due to them being, you know. However, when Saya died and she spread her seeds throughout the world, I actually cried. The thing with the doctor ended in a perfectly ambiguous way as well, unless I missed something after she finished her vodka at the top of the mountain. Overall, it was beautiful in a way I can't describe (try as I might). It was an amazing experience, and I feel recommending it to anyone will make me look like the protagonist at the end of a Lovecraft story actually. Now if you excuse me, I need to schedule an appointment with my therapist.I just watched Your Name, I need to get my thoughts out [SPOILERS] The credits literally just finished rolling. I know I'm crying but there aren't any more tears coming out. It's actually very late where I am so it's very hard being quiet. I've heard it compared a lot with A Silent Voice but even that didn't affect me this much (and that movie was amazing too). The only other movie that made me cry this much was The Green Mile. The whole thing, the characters, the plot, everything was amazing. The part in the middle hit me like a ton of bricks, it really came out of nowhere. I thought the film was going to be about them trying to find each other because they didn't know who each other were (I guess it was kind of about that now that I think about it) like at the beginning of the movie. But the whole thing with the meteor just came out of nowhere. This movie totally destroyed me, man. I seriously think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Period.AITA for making my brother help me move to a different place in the crowd at a concert I'm M17 and my brother is 20 if that matters. I was at Knotfest with my brother on Saturday and when Slipknot started their first song people started moshing what I thought at the time (it's a bit foggy in my memory because it happened so quickly) was all around us. I started to get kind of scared because this crowd already seemed more crazy than any other metal festival that I had been to, especially so looking back on it. He was able to help guide/drag me somewhere else with some other stranger helping. We were able to find a place about a minute later and I calmed down and we were both able to enjoy the rest of the night. He kept asking me if I was ok though so I was afraid that because of what happened I couldn't let him as much fun as he could have. I feel really bad for this whole thing even though it was days agoI have (technically) graduated from HS today, here's some useless advice I am making for some reason (probably not advice just me ranting or something) (technically because the whole commencement ceremony hasn't happened yet) For the past 4 years I have been slowly learning what I will now type out here in this Reddit post to a bunch of random people that I don't know and don't know me. Basically is that you really need to do your work. It may seem hard and unnecessary and it might be but seriously need to do it. There were a couple years I slacked off and I was really in danger of not graduating if I continued at that rate (I didn't) or going to a continuation school (I didn't do that either). Also, no one gives a shit about you or whatever. \"Oh but you don't know my situation\". That is correct but I feel my point still stands. This isn't some shitty anime where everyone cares what stupid shit you are doing. Just have fun doing what you want (within reason). Cliche, I know but it seriously is true. In fact people may like you better for having fun and not being afraid of any social stigma. The reality is that everyone cares too much about themselves to really care about the one thing you did that you regret, even if it wasn't that bad. Basically if America can forget the stupid shit the President does in a day some high schoolers will forget anything you might do in no time. Those stupid things anyway probably aren't even that stupid. I used to hate myself for trying to talk to people in my classes so I was the quiet kid for 3.5 years. One of my teachers thought I was deaf and some people thought I was mute. What I'm trying to say is just go out and do things no matter how scary they may seem to you. Except drugs, you don't want to be hooked on anything. I know some people my age already complaining about how much their nicotine addiction is costing them. I don't know where I went with this. Thanks for reading.I didn't realize how stories could stay scary almost 100 years later I picked up a small collection of stories from the Cthulhu Mythos last week. I had an interest in Lovecraft but I never really read any of his stories (except Call Of Cthulhu but I was very young, only 14 or so so I didn't really understand it) until the past couple days. I had a 2 hour period at school yesterday where we did nothing so I pulled out this collection of stories and began reading. The first was Dagon and I absolutely loved it. Well, not at first. It took a few minutes to totally sink in, the whole thing was just so sudden. I probably thought that because of its length. I did really like it afterwards though. The Call Of Cthulhu was the next story and I had a very bare bones memory of what happened that I was pretty much reading it for the first time again. This one took me quite a while to read given its length (I was also listening to Wayne June narrate it to help me focus from everyone talking and messing around in the room). I did find it pretty boring until they got to the Alert and when Cthulhu finally awakened (I think). This is when it did seem to become creepy, given the whole idea of things beyond our understanding and what not. It probably would have been more creepy if I didn't have so may preconceived notions about Cthulhu from popular culture but that's besides the point. Right now I am on the third story in the collection, The Dunwich Horror. This is where I am actually scared. I am listening to Wayne June narrate it as I read and it is definitely helping the atmosphere of the whole story for me. The entire thing with the family, Wilbur being Wilbur, and finally the horror itself which is kind of where I am now. >!the Fryes I believe it was were just \"erased\"!< and the horror itself has yet to be revealed but I do have an idea. This whole thing about a strange family, an abomination under God himself, the doctor staying awake all day and night deciphering the diary, just everything is very creepy. My imagination is probably making it worse than it is but that's kind of the point isn't it? Sorry for the ramble I am just very excited by my entire perception of life and reality being thrown into question.I just finished reading Hombre by Elmore Leonard It is only the second Western that I have read (the first being True Grit not too long ago) and this was a great book I gotta say. I came about reading it because my creative writing teacher recommended it to me after he saw I liked True Grit. If you don't know the book is about some men and a couple women who try to go on a short wagon journey to another town before some stuff happens, standard Western stuff really. The focus is on a man named John Russell, this mysterious man with a reputation and various nicknames (one being Hombre). I know I'm bad at explaining it but it really was great. The other book my teacher told me to read was Lonesome Done and I've heard that one is amazing so I am looking forward to it. I'm very glad I am getting back into reading again.[TECH] Can't get battery cover off of controller I have the special edition creeper controller and I can not get the batter cover off of it. There is a play and charge battery in it but recently it stopped holding a charge so I am trying to take it out so I can use regular batteries until I can figure out what is wrong but the back cover will not come off. I took the cover off of my other controllers to make sure I was doing it right but I can't get the cover off. I am afraid to use too much force out of fear I will break it.[WSIB] JoJo Eyes Of Heaven, Jump Force, or Persona 5 As you can tell I'm a big fan of anime and I don't know which to buy. I played the demo for JoJo EoH and it seemed pretty fun but I don't know if the full game will be worth the 60 bucks or not Jump Force seems very cool given that I like a lot of the series represented in it but I dont know how good the actual game is Persona 5 interests me because it seems like everyone loves it but I haven't been able to get into many RPGs in the past with a few exceptions. It is the cheapest however. Or I can not get any of these and get Steins;Gate elite when that comes out because I already know it's going to be good because it's a remake. Edit: I have ordered Persona 5. Thank you guys for your help.So I just got back from my friend's church's Halloween party So last year it was what you'd expect, standard church games and shit like that and it was like that too for the most part. Well, they also had this \"scary\" maze last year so me and my friends were excited for this so we could joke around and mess with each other. They separate us into groups, me and my friend C are in group 3 while K and T are in 2. They get called so me and C watch the World Series while we wait (go Dodgers). Also I should mention we haven't seen the our friend whose church this is yet. Group 3 is called so me and C head into this room met with this middle aged chick playing a piano. Suddenly, chains labelled with stuff like \"fear\" and \"loneliness\" fall from the ceiling and she wraps herself in them screaming weirdly. NEXT they played a scene from Passion Of The Christ (the weird Mel Gibson movie) and then a dude talks to us about how Satan is always trying to trick us. Next room, dude talks to us about how he got so deep into sin that he woke up one night being choked by demons and could only hear static. So he called upon Jesus and it stopped. Then he showed us a video where a dude makes a deaf guy hear again by putting his hands over his ears and saying something like \"in the name of Jesus\" over and over again until the guy can hear again. 3rd and final room, we're going upstairs when our friend K passes by and tries to tell us something but we don't hear him. Later we found out he was warning us. The 3rd room was this very dimly lit room with a big table in the middle. Off to the side is a guy on a couch with a woman speaking gibberish and saying Jesus every now and again. This dude and another chick then walk around and start praying and speaking more gibberish while grabbing us by the head and shoulders. At this point I started saying the Hail Mary out loud because they don't like Catholics (at least my family thought it was funny) before they stop and say we can leave if we want. C and I do the natural thing and GTFO before meeting up with K and T wondering WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT.I just walked in on my parents watching Live PD Usually it's a drunk dude or something on the show but this time it was some dude in Florida (ofc) who got the cops called on him for threatening someone with a sword. He was also shirtless and in a trailer park. So he's sitting there with his hands up because \"he didn't want to get shot\" so the cop asks him why he would get shot and the Florida dude says something about reaching at his pants. Cop: well what do you have in your pants? FL guy: nothing but a very large penis Cop: is it a threat to me? FL guy: it could be Cop: it isn't FL guy: I don't know it could be in the future. *fucking Florida, man*Metalworks13 talks about anime The series no one cared about is back. Seriously tho this is like the only place I can just post thoughts about every anime I'm watching. Anyway let's jump into it because I'm watching quite a few right now. #fall season anime JoJo part 5 - Fucking amazing. Nothing more to say Zombieland Saga - I was not expecting a death metal idol anime with the manager being Hououin Kyoma Bunny Girl Senpai - I don't know what I watched but I'm intrigued That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime - hilarious isekai, will be continuing the series Goblin Slayer - BRUTAL. Very power metal, very dark, and violent. Not counting JoJo part 5 this is my no 1 so far this season. #other anime Psycho-Pass - great sci-fi show. I love the visuals Re:Zero - very fucked up and very fucked up as is tradition for anything by White Fox School Live - Holy shit this was way darker than I thought it would be. I absolutely love it but I can't watch more than 1 or 2 episodes at a time because I get too depressed Eromanga Sensei - ignoring the incestuous pedophilia and the recorder music its kind of funny. Like a 6 or 7/10 when I was expecting a 2/10 And there you have it, my weeb rants for now.I Want Out by Helloween (but it's translated to American Sign Language structure) Up until now People tell us things Nobody ask me what I like They teach us their way But, they they different They convinced themselves right They talk on and on Fed up give up Only thing left want escape Live alone Want escape Leave me alone Want escape Do different things myself Want escape I want live free People tell me blah blah Tell me how see world But I already understand [Acts like being pushed around and says black and white as leaning to side to side] They Push finish Don't push me maximum Your mouth shut up dismissed I decide how live 1 million different perspectives 1 million stupid people Truth? Nobody perfect right Sometimes we need alone No Leave me aloneMe encountering weebs at the theater So this happened earlier today actually. If I'll be honest here I do like some anime and so does my friend, so we decided to go see the My Hero Academia movie in the theater earlier tonight as a way to hang out. On the way there we were joking how we were such weebs and stuff like that because we were going to go see an anime movie. Little did we know the people we would encounter once we got there. At the theater we waited in line to get our tickets and we saw some guys wearing anime shirts, no big deal it is a special showing of an anime movie after all. The first sign that some bad stuff was about to go down was probably the group of young teenage girls absolutely covered in MHA gear. Again, we didn't really think anything of it at the time. Into the theater we go with drinks in hand. We find our seats and realize we're lucky that we bought tickets early because the theater was PACKED. We watch the previews and the movie starts, some characters and action are on screen, people are cheering when cool shit happens, you know normal stuff. And then the main character, Midoriya comes on the screen. This chick a couple seats back would not shut up about how cute he was and literally squealing about it. Thinking this would be the worst we would get me and my friend look at each other in disappointment and try to continue watching the movie. This goes on for a little while, this chick talking about how cute he is before a guy in our row (I'm so glad we were sitting in the row we were) tells her to shut up, which she doesn't. This is already annoying but then they start introducing some of the male supporting characters in the movie. It seemed like every girl, some of them were adult woman even, started squealing and yelling EVERY TIME they introduced another one of the main cast in the movie. The rest of the movie me and my friend just sat there, joking how something in the movie might be a JoJo reference and how we should have pirated the movie instead of coming to the theater because of the weebs who wouldn't shut up. In fact at one point this adult woman right behind me was screeching so loud I had to yell to tell her to shut up. From the parts I could hear of the movie it was pretty good but me and my friend agreed that we probably shouldn't go to see any more anime movies after this.Some quotes from my English teacher this year \"If love was a salad bar I'm looking at a room full of croutons\" \"When I open your notebook and I see calculus I'm going to not look at your assignment because I hate math and I fear the unknown\" \"If I'm looking at a potato salad recipe and I'm thinking 'hey, this looks good!' But then I see that it was written by Jack Jones: leader of the Southern California Ku Klux Klan I'm not going to eat it. I do not believe in racist food that will have comments that say 'this is great before you go cross burning.' \"I think I just witnessed some shit go down The hotel room Im in overlooks the valet and we're only on like the second floor so I can hear people talking if its loud enough So there I was watching TV when I heard some shouting outside I rushed over and saw these 2 dudes with their shirts off yelling about something and a valet worker between them trying to break them up and yelling that security had been called Then this big group of security came out, talked to them, and everyone went on their way I guess. Idk what happened but it was interesting.Metalworks13 talks about anime (even tho no one cares) SO I make these posts every now and then when I'm bored and I feel like giving my thoughts on whatever anime I'm currently watching. I'm watching a couple right now (that I'm willing to talk about) not including the seasonal ones, Dragon Ball Super and K-On! Starting with K-On: it's pretty good. It's your basic slice of life anime with cute girls doing cute things but I'm a fan of that so it's enjoyable. I do kinda wish they did more music stuff along with the eating cake and drinking tea tho, which seems to make up like 80% of the show. Dragon Ball Super is your basic action shonen. Dragon Ball isn't the best but I fucking love it. Only like 7 episodes in but it already has that Dragon Ball feel that we all know and love. I'm watching the sub when I watched the dub for Z so it's funny hearing the Japanese voices but I think I prefer them once I got used to them. This concludes this edition of Metalworks13 weebs out.I'm gonna be starting school as a senior in a couple weeks and I haven't been to a party I'm ok with that. People talk about them just doing drugs and getting absolutely wasted which doesn't sound like the best of fun to me. My dad has said I should try going to a party sometime but I don't really want to for the reason I said above. I have more fun sitting next to my friend playing Hearts Of Iron 4 for hours at a time, watching whatever shitty horror movie has just come out with my friends in the theater, or just sitting at home watching anime. I used to think something was weird about me that getting high or drunk didn't interest me but I realize now it's OK. I know the kind of person I am, what I like to do for fun, and what I don't. I don't know if this was a ramble I just felt like saying this.My journey through becoming a weeb (the reboot) #SPOILERS This was the series no one cared about on the old sub where I just talk about whatever anime I'm currently watching because I can just be myself with how I feel about them and what genres I like. So earlier today I finished White Album 2 and holy shit was that crazy. The main dude who I can't remember the name of (I'm terrible with names in general and them being fictional character's having foreign names don't help) got with Setsuna but it turned out the whole time Touma liked him but she never let him know and all this stuff happened where you see the events of the series from Touma's perspective. Well they bang then he tells his girlfriend, Setsuna, and she explains why she dated him and how she knew Touma liked him but she got between them so it worked out I guess? Touma left to go to Europe and it just kind of ended there and I have no idea how I feel about that rollercoaster it took me on in the span of like 3 episodes. So then I started watching Girls Und Panzer because I needed something more light-hearted after that and this is way better than I thought it was. So it's like the girls' schools have tank teams where they have battles or something? Idk it's cool is what it is. They're battles with the British and American girls were cool AF to watch play out but the battle against the Russians was probably the most intense so far. So yeah that's basically what I've been up to.My journey through becoming a weeb part 5 I bet you thought I was done with these, huh? NOPE. I'll keep making these as much as I want. So anyway because I'm still procrastinating on finishing White Album 2 I'll give you guys the story of how I became a weeb. It was a regular day or night I can't remember really and I was looking at one of my favorite channels on YouTube, Game Grumps, when I noticed they started a series on a game called Doki Doki Literature Club. \"Fuck that\" I said to myself. So I ignored the series for a couple weeks until I saw a post on Reddit about how it was a horror game. Well one day I got quite bored and decided to start watching the series. After like 15 episodes I stopped because I wanted to experience it for myself but I said fuck it and just skipped to part 21 of the GG series (the one with the twist). It was from here that I was absolutely hooked on this shit. And I guess the rest is history.My journey through becoming a weeb part 3 The long awaited 3rd part that nobody wanted in the series no one cared about. Speaking of 3rd parts, this one is about JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 3 so PROBABLY SPOILERS I got to like episode 4 of part 3 I think. So we met Jotaro's grandfather, Joseph, and the Egyptian dude as well as the red haired dude who were accompanying them on their way to Egypt to fight Dio. Sadly they met another stand user on the plane so they crashed off the coast of Hong Kong and they met a bad French dude in a restaurant. That is about as far as I got but I am loving this show so far.My journey through becoming a weeb part 2 The long awaited second part to this epic saga is here! Spoilers of course. I am watching White Album 2 currently, just finished episode 7 and holy shit things went from like 35 to 100 at the end there. Setsuna kissed the main dude who I can't remember the name of, creating an interesting love triangle with the black haired girl who I also can't remember the name of. That concert they did was also really cool but I wonder why they didn't show their song that they wrote themselves. I guess it will be explained later on.My journey through becoming a weeb part 1 AKA I just finished an anime and I want to talk about it. Toradora is the one it was so spoilers for that maybe. The whole thing was crazy. I wasn't expecting them to go in the direction they went in near the end at all, I thought it would have stayed a high school romance thing. I wish the whole thing with Ami apparently liking Ryuji went somewhere but I do like how Taiga and him got together in the end. I didn't like how Taiga left though, the end credits scene did make up for it a little bit. This has been part 1 of my journey through becoming a weeb.Okay one more rant for the night I was watching Trump's State Of The Union and he had that kid who placed flags on veteran's graves in his town. This is not what makes me mad, that kid did good. What made me mad is that Trump said that that kid started a movement of doing this. Wait what? I've been doing exactly that almost my whole life with the BSA and the BSA has probably been doing decades before I was born. I'm not mad at the kid, I'm mad at Trump for totally glossing over the fact this has already been a thing.I was thinking about a story I had to read in middle school earlier It was about some girl who was starting her first day of middle school but her dad had died earlier on so when she greeted her best friend she was like \"we can't hang out anymore because you don't have a father\" and the main girl met a guy she liked and they were going to go on a date but she got stood up and she came to school crying the next day and her former friend was with that dude and making fun of her because it was some kind of sick joke WTF was this story they made us read?Why does Windows Firewall block Steam games and how to turn this off? I'm using the standard defender stuff that comes with Windows 10 and it seems every other game I boot up will come up with Windows Firewall blocking it. When this happens a window pops up that asks if I want to allow it to communicate on public networks and private networks. By default only public is checked (which I think is weird with my limited knowledge of this stuff). So far I've either ignored them or just give it both permissions.Question: Do you have to press MX Reds all the way down to press the key? I hope that made sense. I tried out the reds, blues, and browns at a store and I found out I like the blues and the reds the most (the browns just felt annoying to me). I noticed when I pressed the blues halfway down the letter would pop up so I was wondering if you can also do this with the reds (they didn't have red keyboards hooked up to a monitor). I heard reds were best for gaming so that's why I was considering them. They also seem to be cheaper than the blues.Are these mics good? https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Microphone-Compatible-Chatting-Recording/dp/B00UZY2YQE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1470412904&sr=8-1&keywords=pc+microphones https://www.amazon.com/Zalman-Zm-Mic1-Sensitivity-Headphone-Microphone/dp/B00HZOVW0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8&th=1 From what I've looked up these two people recommend but with the Zalman people say on the Amazon page you need an external sound card or something or that the mic is either amazing or horrible. The other one just seems cheap. I'm leaning towards the Zalman but what do you guys think?Problem with Video RAM I was checking system requirements for games like I usually do when I noticed that depending on what game I look at on http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/ it gives me a different amount of Video RAM. I usually see it says 32 mb like in [this](http://i.imgur.com/ZtURHUT.png) screenshot of the requirements being checked for CS:GO. But in certain games like [Crysis](http://i.imgur.com/oSEdsT7.png) it says I have 1.7 gb of Video RAM. Does my computer decide how much Video Ram to use per program or something because if it was using 1.7 gb instead of 32 mb like it usually does it would make my gaming experience much better. Thanks!I want to help my friend, but our relationship has drastically shifted since her psychotic episode Hey, I hope this is fine here, because I am concerned, confused and worried about a friend. About three years ago, she suffered a psychotic episode because she stayed up for way too long one time - as far as I knew, she had a sleep disorder she had to take meds for, and her family had a history of schizophrenia, so I suppose that's all that was needed. However, after this, I feel her entire personality has shifted. Her episode warranted her having to seek treatment, which she has gotten a lot better from, but I almost feel like this psychosis never quite \"went away\" so to speak. Comparatively, she's doing wonders since then - she's taken up learning another language and doing work related to that! She does have an amazing sense of determination when she intends on something. However, she does have various delusions from time to time, and this is where I lose her. Thankfully they haven't been at the severity or intensity since that episode, but every now and then it seems her mind will focus on a very specific thought and she becomes very agitated with others. As an example, I stream games as a hobby on the side. She wanted to join in but mentioned to NOT stream one game in particular. Streaming this game, according to her, will lead to me being swatted on stream. At first I tried to ask questions taking the delusion legitimately - the internet can be really terrible so I thought it was some internet trolls but there isn't some wide mass swatting going on for this game: in fact, it really isn't played that much and if it was, it's getting 5 viewers max based on twitch. The one thing I've learned is that trying to ration or logic through a delusion can actually be more harmful, so I try to not do that. I don't attempt to dismiss her thoughts but any time I ask, \"What do you mean?\" or ask her to explain it further she gets mad at me, tutting, sighing, and telling me vague things like \"The walls have eyes\" and \"You have much to learn\" She gets mad that I don't simply \"get it\" and that I can't read her mind. When I ask her to tell me what she's thinking (not even trying to judge her thoughts, just trying to know what they even are), she will give a vague statement like above and so I'm more confused, and then my confusion pisses her off. While this example isn't really hindering me, I'm worried what might happen if she develops specific thoughts that would be damaging to herself or others. Our friendship has deteriorated because it's become impossible to have a discussion; a lot of it is now lecturing me to do certain things based on her paranoia. Any resistance to following along leads to condescension and her yelling, which is probably where my biggest problems lie - after the episode, her aggression has ramped up - while I don't feel like I'm in physical danger, her patience for people \"not getting it\" is non-existent and her response is to yell at them and treat them like they're idiots for it. This is the most frustrating bit for me, because I do have a sensitivity to any yelling coming from an environment like that, so my response due to my own personal shit is to back off. But in backing off, it's literally causing me to keep my distance, because I don't want to get yelled at again. I suppose what should I do, if I should do anything? Is there something wrong with how I'm approaching her, leading to this? It's hard to begin to understand what she's feeling but I want to try in a way that isn't going to make things worse, which I'm worried I might be doing here. Any insights or thoughts would be much appreciatedShared Laundry Room I would like to write an ode to the neighbor who ‘generously’ ran my load with some eye-wateringly foul dryer sheet. To the neighbor who dumped my dryer load on top of the dryer midway through and stole my cycle to save a dollar. To the neighbor who left their laundry in the wash the entire weekend, and to the neighbor who now takes these matters into their own hands in a matter of a few short hours. Yes, the laundry situation sucks. Yes, we’re all sick of the landlord nickel-and-diming us while oblivious to the overloading abuse the machines will suffer for it. But do we really need to make this situation any worse??? I pointedly do not mess with other peoples’ shit. I do not molest, contaminate, or otherwise assist the passage of said shit, no matter how long it has sat there. If it’s there long enough, hell, I’ll drop the quarters you need in the slot and let you put your dryer sheet of choice in there. This is how I’d like to be able to handle these things, but I’m at my wit’s end. Thanks for reading.Sudden Realization About Time Travel I was just watching the film \"[I'll Follow You Down](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B0986WPXP4/ref=atv_hm_fx2yr0_brws_1_194)\" (a good movie, I recommend it), and realized that if time travel is possible, the reason we don't see concrete evidence of past time travelers is this: If someone were to undeniably observe a time traveler, that would immediately make the universe one where time travelers may appear, which would mean a potential eternity of future travelers flooding the past for greener pastures. If someone figures out how to travel through time, they're clearly appearing in another universe! Now, there is the possibility of time travelers existing - they just haven't been definitely observed as such. That means that time travelers in this universe are kinda like Schrodinger's cat in that they could be time travelers - or not. So I guess the fact that there aren't time travelers on every street corner means one of three things: Time travel is impossible backwards, time travelers must go to another universe, or... humanity doesn't last long enough for future time travelers to be a recognizable portion of people in the past. So... that's nice, I guess. No grandfather paradox, whoopee.Suggestion for the Spotter Scope Hello - I noticed there have been some changes to the spotter scope, and I wanted to draw from the way spotting is done in real life to improve the gameplay. As we all know, the scope has been rather broken in its ability to see through foliage, and leaves magical markers where players go around corners. To combat this, for whatever reason, the devs decided to make it so you have to manually scan, which doesn’t fix the issue, and the marks expire sooner, which is a band-aid. The way I would have fixed this issue is to make it so that when a player is using the spotter scope, the marks are green, active, and track movement, but when you stop aiming the scope or lose line of sight, the marks should turn red and stop moving, then expire after like twenty seconds. This would remove the use for it in single player, but frankly a spotter doesn’t do his own shooting IRL anyway. It’s a support role, and we shouldn’t worry about the user’s pet wallhack being compromised. Thanks, and I hope the devs see this, and that you wonderful fellow players consider my idea instead of going with the common “new thing bad” or “I don’t wanna play for my team” approach.Bigotry? I keep matching with randoms that will repeat the n-word or have homophobic names, or things like that. Does anyone else get repeatedly stuck with blabbering disgruntled lowlifes? They ruin comms because if I just mute other players, then I don’t have the option to communicate. I don’t even care that they are bigoted if they’re contributing to team play - but they just try to get a rise out of everyone and that’s what bugs me. I guess I just wish that you could open the map or something like that and mute certain people.Nosiness and Defamation I saw a video on YouTube of a guy pointing out stuff that's OK in Japan but illegal in most other places, and discovered that they have legal protection against public defamation even for things that the prosecutor or person in question actually did. This got me thinking about how uppity America has been lately. I repeatedly find myself in a rut with members of my extended family with regards to social norms, where they'll pull arguments like, 'if the cops were there, you did something to bring them,' or 'what have you got to hide?' I say that I don't think I'm doing anything wrong when I don't like people prodding me for tea to spill. No, I don't have anything to hide, but if you keep asking you'll be the last person I tell about it. I think so many problems here in the US are caused by people finding some uppity shit to start with passerby. Authenticity seems almost criminal. Am I crazy when I fantasize about some Karen getting her lard-ass bit by her pet judge?front signals and headlight don’t turn on, check engine light blinks nine times Hello, the title says the important stuff. Some potentially relevant details: - the rear signals and brake light work - implies the relay in front has power. - the speedo/tach/odometer screen works and seems normal aside from the check engine light. - I checked the connection to the front light sub-harness, and every terminal appears to make contact. This leads me to think maybe there is another thing leading to both phenomena. I can’t find what nine blinks mean with a Google search, especially since it doesn’t do more than that (i.e., nine and one, or nine and two). Anyone have experience/insight with this?Can heat shrink tubing he shrunk flat? I’m redoing a motorcycle wiring harness to be more readable, so I want to flatten out the wires and use clear heat shrink to bundle and insulate them. These wires still have their individual cladding, but the nice arrangement and color coding is wasted behind a pound of black electrical tape! Will the wires just curl back into a round bunch, or is there a tool you all would recommend to make the tubing hold a flat shape? Or perhaps is there a functional alternative? Thanks in advance.[request] Help a creator who had to choose between her channel and her health. Recently the ASMR creator Love, Sofia ASMR has discovered she has cancer. She seems to be on track for a swift recovery, but her channel will take a potentially crippling hit. I was hoping that you all, as fellow ASMR viewers, could comment on your favorite ASMR creators’ videos to let them know about this small creator and her plight. I was thinking even if just a few creators could make a video each to keep her channel alive while she gets better, it would make a world of difference. She does the impossible: role-play, but without the cringe. She’s very good at helping suspend disbelief and keep immersion, which is arguably one of the biggest things in ASMR. I recommend you [check her out](https://youtu.be/RS7Fl_XSkkY), of course subscribe if you like her style… It would be a shame to lose her and her content despite her probable recovery. I myself will be spreading the word, even if I am alone. Thank you, ~a lowly viewerVery new rider here, and I had a (maybe silly) idea... When I was learning how to operate a motorcycle with a manual transmission, it was rather tough coming from being an avid cyclist for eight years. On bicycles, the rear goodies are all on the right, and the front goodies are all on the left. Easy to remember, and pretty intuitive as well. Learning that the drivetrain crap is on the left, and both brakes/throttle were on the right was terribly jarring... But mostly due to clutch control. Manual transmissions don't faze me conceptually and it was easy to visualize what was going on. However, I just couldn't see the advantage of having a manual clutch other than making revving sounds at stops (and also to keep the beater bike they had me on from stalling). That's when I had an [idea](https://imgur.com/gallery/EwRH7ea). I wanted to make a lower throttle begin to engage the clutch, no throttle to be kissing the friction zone, and then turning the throttle backward would fully engage the clutch. An alternative would just be to have the clutch enter the friction zone a bit early and then fully disengage the transmission by the time the throttle is idle. Am I but a sweet summer child, or do I have a good idea here? Has this been tried? (I feel like it's so simple that it must have been tried in cars and motorcycles alike.) EDIT: u/BluPengwin pointed out in the comments that Rekluse has been making such a clutch (known as an [auto clutch](https://rekluse.com/product/core-exp-3-0-clutch/)) for years now. It's based on RPM though. I feel bummed but at least not stupid.Discussion: What is Ancapistan’s solution to child negligence? I have been pondering abortion and the portion of “human-ness” that relies on self-sufficiency, versus species or other taxonomic traits such as age or (once upon a time) race. Something that endlessly puzzles me is whether willful negligence of a demonstrably incapacitated human is (or ought to be) always a crime. It’s simple enough in theory to call abortion “self defense,” at least in the realm of plausible deniability. But then, what’s a child? Does a child have rights? Can a child own anything? If a child’s right to life effectively indentures that child’s parent to said child, then who’s indentured to a mentally unstable homeless man? The intellectual purity I ascribe to libertarianism falls apart in my head when dependents enter the scene.Something I noticed about Youtube comments... I have encountered comments that show up as \"liked\" (the thumbs-up is filled in) but that when I click them, the \"like\" quantity goes up. Only some comments do this, and I figured it was some kind of desync bug with comments I forgot I liked. It's happened both on PC and the mobile app. However, I was just watching a brand-new video by the popular channel Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell, and encountered this phenomenon on a comment I could not have possibly seen before that point. What is this sorcery, and has anyone else seen it?Trouble with a coworker So I work in overnight freight, and my coworker constantly complains about how the offloading crew are ‘jerkoffs’ (which some of them are). He drives the OP (order picker) to put up heavy stuff like toilets, doors, etc. But then he does the following: He closes off two aisles at a time (good), puts one or two boxes up, and makes us wait… and THEN we have to put up all the little shit he left because it’s beneath him (“a waste of his time”). Some of it isn’t even little and needs at least a ballymore, but while we’ve been inventory tagging he repeatedly fucks us over by making us wait in that crucial last hour. Is there anything I can do? I’d drive the OP but they never gave me my license (after I drove it and did the training), and they just keep the other guy doing it. I just wish we had other wage-earners who care about completion.Here’s a thought… I’m starting to believe that the economic left and right are completely arbitrary distracters… like, in the US, I’m a water boy sitting on one end of the net in a game of tennis, watching the Democrats and Republicans whack the ball back and forth while creeping further and further from me. I have to run further and further every match to bring them water, and these days, I gotta climb the far fence too. Does anyone else here get the impression that the notion of economic liberty is inseparable from its social counterpart? like I’m utterly confused about the top-right and bottom-left of the classic political compass.I’m going to go through why exactly I feel mask mandates to be inhumane - or at least unprecedented. We’ve been at this coronavirus thing for over a year now. People have died, tears have been shed, and people are deeply mired in their positions on public duty versus individual liberty. In the US, most people don’t care if you are barefaced outside - just like if you don’t wear a shirt or shoes. This checks out - what others think of you alone has no objective impact on their well-being. However, in most US workplaces (especially corporate and/or service-based jobs) employers are coerced to make their employees wear masks at work. From a regulatory standpoint, some might compare this to state-imposed safety measures when using mechanical equipment (which I know many on this sub would oppose, but I’ll show why it’s different anyway). This comparison doesn’t work, because measures taken to do a specific task are analogous to traffic laws, which control a privilege, not a right. You make a choice to do a task, and your full understanding of the strings attached is assumed. Whereas, regulating gainful employment squashes something upon which our livelihoods must be able to depend. Furthermore, working a paying job does not necessitate any particular activity, yet masks are mandated across the board. Though it seems trivial to some, never before have we so aggressively limited human free will over what amounts to a passive threat. (Though that threat is admittedly multiplied by lifestyle choices). Continually I see arguments for people with breathing problems to get an exception, or people who work outside - but I say that on principle, mask mandates are inhumane. There are methods of protecting yourself from the coronavirus such as face shields, frequent hand washing, and self-isolating, yet these are rarely seen or encouraged. Instead we must rely on surgical masks, which for those who don’t know, are only intended to contain aerosolized contaminants, and not as a shield (or security blanket, for that matter). Perhaps we seem crazy to some, but some of my coworkers and I think that mask mandates are simply a government test of authority, before moving on to something bigger. Few seem to notice the rapid transition to government-controlled corporatism that is already rampant in China, and those who do incorrectly label it as capitalism. I sincerely hope my fears are immaterial, implicit schizophrenia notwithstanding.Skip the racket - get a box fan! I have 6 RGB fans as well, but I’m growing fond of [Frankenstein’s Monster](https://imgur.com/gallery/9eOVho7) EDIT: I installed a [filter](https://imgur.com/gallery/Okn7GYc) because I’m not THAT dumb… EDIT 2: for clarity, I pointed the box fan so that it is blowing air into the case and out the back vent (where the CPU cooler and GPU are). This only can work well for you if you have case intake fans installed already or cover all of the intake vents in the case. your typical 120-140mm exhaust fans might only be a hindrance with the kind of airflow I’m getting lol (a bit like trying to make a jet engine fly faster with a propeller) EDIT 3 (dammit): by racket I was referring to racketeering, but now I can’t change the title to clarify that… The fan is loud, but my headphones make it so I don’t careAm I the jerk here? I work in D38 (freight) and have been having trouble with my supervisor. Every time he talks to us as a group he tells us to take pride in the store and own our work. However, whenever he interacts with me he constantly is telling me to hurry up. I know for a fact that most of my coworkers aren’t paying the same attention to detail that I am, and I’m just trying to do what my job asks of me. Am I crazy for thinking deadlines are too much for an hourly worker? like my stance is that the deadline is completion. You want me to not sleep at night (well day technically) then give me a salary or do it yourself. I can’t decontaminate, pack down and face up more than 2 bays in an hour and a half with the store like it is, if I am doing it correctly (especially depts 25, 26, and 27 with all the little stuff). And with the management being stingy with overtime, I’m getting fed up with constantly being interrupted halfway and moved somewhere else when I’m just trying to do my job and take advantage of the lack of customers. Should the day crew appreciate me, or should I quit? I’m happy to interact with customers if I don’t have to lie to them.Theoretical Question **Preface** I recently started mining Ethereum on my newly built gaming rig, to find that I would get about a dollar a day with my 6gb rtx 2060 on the 2miners Ethereum pool. I felt like I wanted to take a bigger gamble that wasn't so cushy and essentially predicated on market fluctuations - so I read about solo mining, and how it is considered unfavorable. I wondered if it could still work out, which brought me down a rabbit hole of trying to figure out what a block even is, and how the ethash algorithm for GPU mining is defined. Then I got stuck. **Question** With this in mind, if two people mine the same block, will it take the same number of hashes for each? If so, is ethereum mining essentially pointless if you aren't on the biggest available mining pool/rig, or is there still a random non-ping-related chance for the little guy? At this point I'm worried I'm burning (albeit cheap, for me) electricity to chase inflation.Gem purchase didn’t remove ads forever I bought a gem pack on iOS for the sole purpose of removing story-line ads, which worked great (I think of it like buying the full version of a game after using the ‘trial’ version). However, on my first play-through, I killed the Astari off before I learned how to best make my followers happy, and took a while to figure out how to nudge plots into a more efficient grid. I want a re-do. So, I restarted the game only to find the ads were back! I am sad, and I wish they had told me my gem purchase and ad immunity were gone forever…Unfair Exploit, even more unfair punishment for disconnect. Twice in a row I got killed by someone in Metro, Advanced Mode leaving their spawn bubble early. Anyone else have this happen? Also, I have lost three separate loadouts to disconnecting from basic mode - one was the pink AWM, I disconnected because a griefer teammate was spamming his GL at us and then chasing us down and reviving us. The other two were from accidental app closing/battery dying. Disconnects should not be worse than dying under any circumstance, in any mode; and someone has got to fix whatever cheat people are using to leave the spawn early at the bottom left of the second/third map. Overall, I really enjoy Metro Mode, but these issues have been getting on my nerves this past week.My laptop is dead, and it’s time for a rebirth. I’ve recently gotten into gaming, and have been doing well with a laptop/eGPU setup with a 2060. However, my laptop keyboard fritzed out. I highly suspect the one I found to order is not going to fit due to the flat flex cable not being arranged the right way. If this is the case, I want to harvest the laptop’s valuable parts and my 2060, and try to build a workable gaming desktop from those. Is this possible? If so, what will I need, what will be useful, and where do I get it? Thanks in advance. (Below is a link to what I have, from a Lenovo Ideapad 730s/Yoga s730) [Imgur, sweet silicon shots](https://imgur.com/gallery/iQXHFvd) Ask for further info, if my pics are missing something relevantIs this unusual? I have kind of always had nightmares involving being forced to move or not move outside of my will, but only really had sleep paralysis once. However, that one time, I had it for so damn long that I ended up resigning to it and falling back asleep. There seemed not to be any figmented apparition or figure at all until I fell back asleep. That night I had the first of a long series of dreams in which I was drawn by levitation into an underground area, like something in between a sewer and an old brick corridor, and had the sense that something was tossing me around for fun, poltergeist style. It was no good, and those dreams haunt me even when I'm awake, to the point where if it's quiet or I'm watching a video about something paranormal, I get super creeped out. I'm not usually superstitious, and generally only get got by jump scares... but this phenomenon is a stark exception to the rule. Anyone else have this or something like it?I have some concerns with information availability. I would like to express here some concerns I've had about general misinformation, bias, and the nasty money-driven game of 'telephone' that has occurred over the past year, concerning the novel coronavirus. **COVID-19 and SARS-CoV2 are not the same**; the former is a respiratory symptom, while the latter is the virus which happens to include that symptom in the name. In my opinion, the names are disingenuous and seemingly intended to cause confusion - the name of the symptom that people die from doesn't contain the term 'SARS,' despite that being the category of symptom. Instead, the worst symptom of the virus is in the *virus's* formal name, and the name of the symptom is what everyone uses to refer to the virus. This destroys specific communication and inflates our understanding of viral impact inherently. It's only pedantic if we can be sure most people understand the difference, and I'm not sure, as such. Furthermore, popular media had decided to capitalize on viral fearmongering, butchering the already ambiguous terminology to the point of no return. Since politicians use the media to understand and communicate with the public, our chief policy makers worldwide are entirely misinformed. **The high death toll of the novel coronavirus in America is perhaps oversimplified.** Donald Trump, for all his flaws, did not give Americans the novel coronavirus - instead, I believe the larger impact of COVID-19 in the US is largely due to comorbidities perpetuated by a system that specializes in (and capitalizes on) treatment, and doesn't care about the cure. We Americans are fat, lazy, and generally unhealthy. To argue with that is to deny one of the few national attributes Americans can claim anymore. (Ever seen Family Guy? It's basically 21st century King of the Hill. *Hank Hill 2.0 - dumber, fatter, and now with more politics!*) **Elitism lurks behind the COVID narrative.** In the US, at least, the DNC and especially the progressive left have seen an insane change of heart over the last year. In 2018, the political dialogue had focused on the young, single demographic for a long time - perhaps a couple of decades or more. At the beginning of 2020, however, the American political left quickly went from \"Ok Boomer\" to \"Let's All Hide in A Hole or Die Trying While Grandma Goes Shopping.\" I am among the resulting disenfranchised single youth, and I can tell you that nothing is good about my more gullible, activist peers finding themselves politically marginalized. Now more than ever, I hope a sort of Libertarian party emerges to prevent any further dodgy shifting of core values by the current bipartisan scheme. Some politicians need to lose their comfy salaries over the total fiasco of 2020. Dunno about you, but I'm experiencing some serious buyer's remorse over my biweekly tax withholdings. Thoughts?Kicked. Let me explain a li'l something. &#x200B; [I was kicked twice from different sessions within the same 10 minutes, for doing literally nothing.](https://preview.redd.it/1s5c0u9u8pe61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e16ecbb2965185b1aeb404043c15724c88a3187) I can understand wanting to protect your cargo or have a friends-only session where you can actually do stuff like heist preps and CEO work, but you can do that without placing randos into the Bad Sport Lobby. Let me tell you how. First enter Story Mode. Then pause and go to Online. Scroll to Join GTA Online. Then, start a **2-Crew lobby.** *A single, closed crew lobby won't let you be CEO, MC President, etc*. Then all you have to do is own the 2 crews that you have in the lobby so you know who's in them. Invite from both, and voila, **no trolls can join and you get to do CEO work**. You don't have to give bad sport points to randos who just logged on to mess around, do car meets, roleplay or whatever-the-fuck-else. Spread the word!How do I deal with my mom? I'm 19 and currently looking for a job after dropping out of university due to a general lack of motivation. COVID complicated things, but I don't think it would have been much different anyway if COVID hadn't happened. I earned a bit of money working in a fruit packing facility at the same time as pursuing my studies, but then wrongfully quit my job to focus on school when the school was what was draining my morale. I am currently in an apartment of my own and support myself on savings. Now, every waking moment is and should be worrying about calls back from employers, to keep that going. However, it seems my mom both takes more attention from me than that does, and insists that me finding a job is her thing and her doing. While I'm free to do as I wish and am applying for jobs in my area, she assumes I'm frittering away all of my time and that I am now at her beck and call. So most mornings at around 8 AM I recieve a passive aggressive text like, \"Any life progress?\" \"Manage to apply anywhere today?\" etc. etc. which are always either exaggeratedly minute or unspecific, forcing me to say yes... as if she'd asked \"did you remember to wear underwear? Did you do a good job today?\" ...or she is calling in a favor, such as recently when I went to help her friend move into a new house, or this morning when she wanted me to shovel her driveway. Every time she texts me it's framed with the presumption of total availability, and guilt trips me into a position where I am always the asshole. She's just constantly pushing me, daring me to say no, and doesn't realize it makes me want to pull out my hair, run for the hills, and be a career homeless man. Is this just me being a pansy, or is there something I can tell my mom that will make her understand that I'm doing my best and she doesn't own me anymore? Mind, when I've confronted her in the past, she gets agitated and tells on me to my stepdad, whom she panders in every way and whom I get along with, but yet whom I can never seem to convince of her damaging communication style.Purpose... Remember what it feels like? I've made exactly one attempt to take my own life. 2016, on an exchange program, literally unable to cry for help to anyone around me because of the language barrier, and believing the only thing worse than death would be going back home to my toxic parents. I'm getting the feeling again, but it's more lucid. Less emotional. Tonight, I heard the ping of my phone notification, beginning a cycle I've seen many times since narrowly becoming financially independent from my family. Once again, my mom is desperately trying to prod me into action, toward some vague and romanticized image of success. My stepdad sees me as nothing but a liability, and if I don't feel like being my mom's little doormat, he treats me like I'm twelve years old again. Catch-22? I want to save myself, from them, for someone, but for who? I've got a couple of months' worth of money saved away, and I don't have a job. I just dropped out of school, because I just don't care about that anymore. Though it's what I've been primed for, it's not me. I quit my previous job because I was busy being a student and not myself. I was tired. But now I have neither, and the only thing my parents can do is berate me and constantly nag me. This does nothing but make me feel like a hopeless twelve-year-old whelp. I'm well off for a 19-year-old! ...But the only thing they can do is see where I could be better by their standards. What they don't understand is that I'm not their responsibility. If I never get a job, and I run out of money, I'll flesh out my lease, grab a couple of belongings, throw the rest in the trash, and attempt to never see them again. But they're toxic... they can't understand or believe that, because their excessive molding and pressure made me complacent during childhood. They only judge me by my coping mechanism. It's all they know me by, and I can't even begin to get to know them as equals, as people, because they can't help but see me as a burden. When I attempted suicide in 2016, I was saved by how dumb and harebrained my scheme was. The method was flawed, and before I changed the procedure adequately, people entered the room and my \"contented\" mask went back on. When I've periodically felt suicidal since then, and tried to talk to my parents about it, they were angry at me for wasting their time, and told me I wouldn't do it. I guess they were right, and I hate that. I hate their toxicity. I hate my younger self's complacence. So tonight, I have turned here, as I've done before, and saw a comment on a post from a year ago, from someone who claimed an elderly store clerk saved their life by giving them a sticker when they were fourteen. It made me think about all the people who feel just like me, but for different reasons, and how goddamn easy it would normally be for anyone to help me. How easy it would normally be for *me* to help someone else. I hate myself... I would change... but COVID-19 has taken that decision out of my hands. Taken my purpose away, and made me unable to bring joy to anyone, because I can't please my parents, and I don't know how to help anyone else. I *can't* help anyone else, by government mandate. I can't point any fingers, I can't blame anyone... not even myself. I picture 6 months from now... politicians will politician, media will media, people will people, all while I hide from my parents and the world. My parents say I'm not being accountable enough. My few friends abandon me because I abandoned them. And then I finally say I'm done. What more is there? I killed my mask. My real self has only just emerged from its cocoon, and it's soft. Afraid. Alone. Abused, by my parents, but moreso by me. I tell myself a mantra: I'll get a job. Not for my parents, but they don't know that. I'll find a friend. They'll see me, surely. But for now, I'll survive. Not for later, but for now. And oh boy will it be hard. My story's not the saddest, the least privileged, the most interesting, the most enlightening. It's not a fairy tale, and it's not a cautionary tale. It's just a brief call into the brisk December air as I come up for a breath from all of my fakery. Before I go back under, I really do wish you all a happy December, wherever you are, if you can believe it. For what it's worth to you. I guess I'll text my mom back. God I'm tired. Now where's that mask...The Job Creator. Hello fellow humans! Note: if you don't want to read my buildup story, **feel free to skip straight to Paragraph 9** (the suggestions are formatted as a quote). I feel it sets the mood, but it isn't necessary to the discussion, and was more of a way to express my personal experience with the topic at hand. I recently have been trying to learn how to take full advantage of the Creator in GTA Online, first starting with Survivals, then moving on to Stunt Races. I found it challenging, and due to the series of events I am about to describe, have come up with some suggestions for the interface and save functions of the Creator. I had recently created a Stunt Race (called \"Threading the Needle\") whose main intent and theme was zipping supercars into and out of tight spaces, and fine tuning the angles of ramps to make landing somewhat foolproof. I ran into several issues while dealing with the interface: 1. **You can't look up.** Given that your camera can't phase through objects, this means if you go into a tunnel or one of the buildings at the port, you have to repeatedly zoom and wiggle your movement and try to blindly dodge any obstacles or ledges in order to escape. This can prove quite frustrating after placing large props such as ramps or stunt track. 2. **Placement.** The criteria for whether an object clips through other objects are quite ambiguous. For example, if I want to place a \"45 degree Stunt Track Up,\" rolled to the side to bank the outer edge of the road on a turn, it often cannot travel that low in order to make the joint flush. In another case, if you have a track high up in the air, and are trying to merge another large object with the side of that track, you have to keep the object levitated next to the track and fiddle with rotation and positioning from there. The minute you accidentally touch the track, the levitation goes away, so the object \"falls off\" and maps to the terrain far below the track. At which point you have to press and hold the key to slowly levitate the object back up (in my case it's \\[R\\]), which brings me to the final point: 3. **Control/Movement speed.** The fastest way to get around the map is to use \\[CTRL\\] + scroll-wheel to zoom out way into the sky, then point your camera down at wherever you want to go, and finally zoom back in. This makes it super annoying to manage the zoom of whatever prop you're placing, because this often puts the object right up in your face. Using \\[R\\] and \\[F\\] for vertical and the usual ASDW for lateral movement takes ages to cross any distance, and as far as I know, there is no speed boost key (like there is for zooming, the \\[CTRL\\] key). After finding my own ways to deal with these minor setbacks (repeatedly and to the point of frustration), I loaded up my map \"Threading the Needle\" and decided to fix the multitude of rough spots, poorly merged geometry, and ramps pointed in the slightly wrong direction. I spent 3 hours fine tuning the position and angles of little building blocks to make smooth, flush surfaces in areas that my test audience had complained about (or had left the match upon encountering)... at which point my game crashed due to a graphics glitch on my end, and I lost all of the fiddly bits I had fixed. So here I am. And all I can think to do is make some suggestions and open them up for discussion, because at the point the interface is so cumbersome that I viscerally dread using it, the feature becomes a worse creative outlet. I'd be happy to redo my work immediately if the battle with the interface wasn't 80 percent of the time spent. But alas it's a big time loss, caused by a crash that is (at times) quite common, depending on what specific hardware you're working with. (In my case I think it was my eGPU). This brings me to my suggestions. >**Have work be autosaved to the Social Club cloud.** The best way I can think of to rectify crash issues with unsaved work is to have a folder for each Job in the Creator, which would have the most recent autosave, an optional restore point that can be made with the existing manual save option, and the published version of the Job. > >**Either make it so the camera can look up, or make it so it can clip through objects.** If the camera can look up, it will facilitate placing props or spawn points in tunnels, buildings, or other hollow structures, and allow easy manipulation from underneath while building a stunt track in the sky, or placing signs on the ceiling of a building or tunnel. If the camera can clip through objects, then it will make navigation easier. If Rockstar has any issues with its players having easy access to content below the map, they could put in a feature that blurs the camera view when the character is clipped into an object, without removing functionality. It's realistic, really; how much do you think you could see with your eyeballs embedded in a wall or mountain? Either feature would serve fine on its own, but both would be phenomenal. > >**Two placement modes: Clip and Map.** For placing props, two modes could be created to work with the existing geometry of San Andreas and any props you've already placed. Clip Mode would keep props at a certain distance from the camera, determined by zooming in or out, and rotation would be controlled by yaw, roll, and pitch like usual. The prop would phase through anything in its location, and merge with that thing when placed. Map Mode would cast a line down the middle of the camera's line of sight, select the nearest surface it encounters, and make an object try to lie flat on *that point* on the surface. Rotation would be determined by world bearings, i.e. the object would swivel on the point of contact, remaining flat. (The funny thing is, most of this functionality already exists; it's just not explicitly under the user's control which mode is being used.) > >**Fly-through movement, speed boost on existing movement, or both.** The existing ASDW controls are often pretty slow, and there's no real control over how fast they go. Fly-though movement would hijack the existing controls of an Mk-II or airplane of some sort, but would remove air turbulence, allow you to stall in the air indefinitely, and allow you to **reverse** (I think this is important, so it's bold). Adding a speed boost to the existing movement would increase movement speed when holding a separate key other than ASDW, such as \\[CTRL\\] (the key used for speeding up zoom). Again, this post is not to bash on Rockstar (they get plenty of that already), but to take a great feature of the game and make it even better, whether for selfish reasons or not. These suggestions I've made are open to discussion and I'd love to engage with this community to see if we can brainstorm and get some actionable ideas implemented by Rockstar. Thanks for reading my rant!Minor sleep deprivation made me hallucinate? Yesterday, shortly before falling asleep, and after staying up all night drinking energy drinks and playing GTA V Online (trying to grind out some in-game cash, which is hard to come by for free), I had the distinct impression that I was rapidly losing my mind. Normally when I'm tired I just fall asleep no matter how much caffeine I drink; the caffeine just helps me stay alert while I'm already awake. However, last night I guess I hit a 'sweet spot' and I sort of got stuck in between sleeping and being awake. I figured the game was making me twitchy from being alert too long, and began watching YouTube to unwind. The first and only video I watched ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF\\_U3L0B4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJEF_U3L0B4), I remember the video because that's when things got weird), I found my brain randomly latching onto little things in the video's content, like words, gestures, etc. and I got the most literal 'tunnel vision' effect that I've ever experienced. This startled me, and I jokingly thought to myself something like, \"Ha, my brain's playing tricks on me.\" I then suddenly had a frightening and nightmarish hallucination of a really vivid brain. Just the otherwise harmless word triggered a terrifying response. I immediately slammed my computer shut, sprinted to my bed, and hid under my blanket like a four-year-old. I fought my way toward a restless sleep, in which I constantly felt like my back was exposed to some unknown threat, even when I laid face-up. Now, after having slept and detox-ed, I still have lingering effects from this incident, mostly of needing to shield my back with a wall, or the floor... like I become afraid of staying standing if I lose focus on what I'm doing. Note that I really only delayed my sleep cycle by 8 hours or so, and consumed no more caffeine than I often do. Has anyone else experienced something like this? It's like everything I normally do is 'realer than life,' and there's a creepy.... something lurking behind me.Anti-hack idea As an anti-hacking measure, someone in development should set up a bot that auto queues the URLs of Youtube/stream videos based on cheat/hack keywords, and scans the upper left of the video every ten seconds or so until it finds usernames to be investigated manually. (Kind of like an automated cheater report.) Text recognition is pretty sophisticated these days and I think that would work well in a number of cases. Not sure how well it would work with chinese/arabic or with low quality video though, so maybe it would just take a snapshot if it isn’t certain.Looking for good mortality data... Anyone have some? I have a hypothesis that the median age for coronavirus deaths is perhaps trending upward since December (implying that the virus is becoming less threatening for people younger than the average life expectancy), but I would like to substantiate this claim with good, reliable raw data. Does anyone have knowledge of suitable data for this purpose? All I need is a list of the age and date of each coronavirus death. ***EDIT:*** *I've pasted here a clarifying (and perhaps enlightening) reply that I made to a comment, which incidentally is longer than the original post:* >If the hypothesis is true, what does that mean? I'm no doctor or virologist, but here's my assessment: It would mean that the virus is changing to have less severe symptoms, especially for young people. This would make sense, as worse symptoms mean the virus is killed quicker and, often, so is the person. The common cold, a rhinovirus, has reached a point of being no more than an annoyance, which was naturally selected for by the fact that non-obtrusive symptoms yielded a longer contagion period and more virus material to be generated. It's a reasonable claim to make that most natural viruses that last very long will end up similar to the common cold. The coronavirus needs the person to be alive and struggling in the fight for as long as possible to hijack cells and create genetic copies of itself to transmit to other hosts. That is the essential life cycle of any virus. (As opposed to bacterial infections which often prefer dead or weak targets, and don't consistently and measurably change in their health risk to a given carrier from transmission to transmission.) It would also mean that immunocompromised, very elderly, and/or especially cautious people would be strongly advised to avoid contact with society at large, but only until the virus becomes a more mild form as it is passed among younger, healthier people. We could use below-life-expectancy death rates as a measure of the virus's severity. This would also serve as a light at the end of the tunnel, and would invalidate the scientifically vapid argument proposed by the left that we can't possibly keep the old inside forever, so we shouldn't bother encouraging it at all. (Instead we mostly lock everyone up but only sometimes and entirely ignore scientific reality pertaining to grocery stores, hospitals, pedestrian light signal buttons, etc. Seems fishy.)A letter to my university's newspaper. **The following is a letter I sent to my university's newspaper in response to a newsletter they regularly send out. I'd like to see the members of this community respond and interact with the statements I have presented here, for I do not believe the newspaper will acknowledge my stance in full impartiality.** This letter is in response to the past several email newsletters that I have recieved, but in particular to the one from June 4th. I find it thrilling that you are shouting out BLM, a movement which has been acknowledged by the FBI as a terrorist group, yet continues to be validated, even in the midst of looting and crime in many major cities across the nation. Wonderful. Splendid. I am just about sick of people being described as the sum of their parts, as black-ness being a movement, a tribe, but not as a rather trivial sunburn resistance that some people are born with (and others are, if anything, jealous of). I do not argue the fact that police are often heinous individuals who commit awful acts. It's called being human, and there's no excuse for letting your human-ness inspire such regrettable acts as racial profiling by the police. I take issue with the treatment of this subject by your organization, and the perpetuation of the collectivist notion that some entire demographic is pointing a finger at another. In general, as more dramatic events have taken place through the last six months, this newsletter appears to me to encourage sensationalist simplification of complex matters, conflate progressive apologist values and justice, and frankly embody everything that is wrong with the media and education industrial complex today. I do not doubt that your publication contains an intellectually diverse content pool. I simply question the selection for the newsletter. Thank you for reading.Why can't I have two void loops running at once? `const int led1 = 12;` `const int led2 = 8;` `const int led3 = 11;` `{` `pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);` `pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);` `pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);` `}` &#x200B; `void loop1()` `{` `digitalWrite(led1, HIGH);` `delay(1000);` `digitalWrite(led2, HIGH);` `delay(1000);` `digitalWrite(led1, LOW);` `delay(1000);` `}` &#x200B; `void loop()` `{` `for(int i = 0; i < 255; i++){` `analogWrite(led3, i);` `delay(10);` `}` `for(int i = 254; i >= 0; i--){` `analogWrite(led3, i);` `delay(10);` `}` `}` Only void loop() runs, not void loop1(). Is it only possible to have one void loop running, if so, is it not possible two have the two different codes running simultaneously?BF 2042 already hinted back in Okt 2014 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2-eU\\_7sfKY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2-eU_7sfKY) . Starting at 5:17, JackFrags goes over an easter egg where the number 42 comes up if you scan a QR code. &#x200B; Actually the whole Final Stand DLC is a hint. DICE tend to hint towards the next games setting with content like weapons. BFH had the M1903 to hint towards BF1. BF1 hinted towards BFV with the Thompson. &#x200B; Sorry if this has already been talked about.How to learn from a karmic lesson? Hello, I'm fairly new to spirituality but I try my best to make research and understand things. Recently I learned that I should make peace with being single because having a partner won't make me happy. I assume that was a karmic lesson i needed to learn from. Another thing that's been bothering me is thaf ever since I went to middle school is not fitting in anywhere that I went. No matter how good are the people around me, I will still feel like an outsider. What am I supposed to learn?Relapsed after 2 months I need to get this off my chest. I relapsed today after being clean for about 2 months, I was starting to get a healthy mindset and not get weird thoughts in my head whenever I masturbated. But ever since February started, I feel like I became bipolar. I get horrible mood swings everyday, I hate whoever is around me and I feel suicidal for no reason. Nothing bad is actually happening in my life, it's all in my head. I hate myself. I feel ugly and unlovable. The girl I like told me yesterday that we're never going to be in a relationship. I feel hopeless. I know I shouldn't base my worth on what other people think of me, but it's just who I am as a person. Horribly codepent, obsessive and crazy. And now that I relapsed I feel even worse. I wish I was someone else.So tired of my angry father Growing up, I realised there are many things that are severely wrong with me and with the help of the Internet + some self reflection, I realised my family is quite dysfunctional. Lately, I've been terrorised by my father. It's annoying to live with a man who constantly screams at anything and is always angry. The problem about him is that logic doesn't work, even if I dissect his actions he has no reason to act the way he does. He fights everyday with my mother, even multiple times a day. Out of all the interactions they have, 70% of them end up in a fight. In my opinion, the fact that they won't divorce makes my dad act uncivilised. Today, he broke down the door to the backyard. Only because my mom called him out about cleaning himself properly once he's in the house, since he works with patients who have covid. He 100% hates my mother. The worst thing is that last month he snapped at me for no reason. One day he was chill, talking to me normally then the other, since I was a bit late to a medical appointment he decided to go absolutely crazy, even though he didn't even have to drive me there or had anything to do with it. I remember I entered the bathroom and my mom said \"when are you coming out, we need to go\" so I said give me 5 minutes I'm showering. When my dad heard that I was showering he snapped, turned into an insane psycho who appeared to be left the asylum and started banging on the door with all his strength while yelling at me. He was saying things like \"you're not normal, you're even worse than your cousin (why him out of all people, just cause he dropped school?), you need to be punished, you're a terrible kid...\" all of this because I was in the bathroom for 5 minutes. What the actual fuck? I'm still infuriated. If I think about it I cry. Even worse, the previous day he was completely calm and he even talked to me about his personal problems etc..., so I don't get why all of a sudden he snapped for something that had nothing to do with him. For context, I haven't gotten scolded in years by my parents. I never had a bad grade since I was 15 and my last \"punishment\" was when I was 8. He genuinely had no reason to be mad that day why did I have to be the scapegoat? He's terrible. A few weeks ago, he snapped at my mom cause she's on calls all the time and in his opinion she never does anything. I find it very hypocritical because until 2 weeks ago he didn't have a job since 2013. He's just fucking insane, I can't comprehend his actions and living with him makes me wanna die. I can't move out cause I'm still in high school (hs ends at 19 here).How to not get overwhelmed by smells? Lately I've been getting super overwhelmed by all smells. Apparently, I'm the only one who can feel how bad everything around me smells and I don't get why. It's gotten to the point where I can't enter a car or eat dinner without feeling like I have to throw up. It's not an hygiene problem, because I can see my parents cleaning around often, but everyday they cook the worst smelling food and I can't take it anymore. Plus, I tried covering it up with febreze and similar stuff but now I just associate the febreze with bad smells, so it smells bad too. Does anyone else have this sort of problem too? If so, how do you deal with it?New to Mbti, help type me Hello. I’m new to the mbti community. I can't figure out my mbti type, because none of them seem relatable. I apologize if I’ll make any grammar errors or misspellings,English isn’t my first language. • How old are you? What's your gender? Give us a general description of yourself. I’m 18, male. • Is there a medical diagnosis that may impact your mental stability somehow? I have asperger’s syndrome and adhd. I was diagnosed fairly late, but the symptoms have been there all my life. I've also been suffering from depression since I was 12. • Describe your upbringing. Did it have any kind of religious or structured influence? How did you respond to it? I was a catholic christian, I only liked going to church because they sang nice and catchy songs, and usually my grandpa would buy me something from the store that was near there after mass finished. Don’t know if it’s relevant,but I bought mangas and magazines. At 12, I stopped believing in God and to this day I’m still an atheist. I mostly believed in God out of fear that I’d go to hell if I didn’t. I don’t have religious trauma, growing up I learned no one in my family really cared about religion. • What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)? Do you like it? Why or why not? I’m currently a high school student. Where I live,we choose a high school based on specific subjects (ex. languages,arts,economics etc…) and I’m studying languages (Russian and Spanish). I used to like it, but over the years it has gotten really boring. Also, the way my teacher explains Spanish is really confusing. Obviously, since I chose this school when I was 13, it would have been impossible for my interests to stay the same over the years. So yeah, I’d say i’m linguistically inclined. • If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed? I’d feel relieved, having no people around would give me the time to re-gain my energy. • What kinds of activities do you prefer? Do you like, and are you good at sports? Do you enjoy any other outdoor or indoor activities? I like activities where talking is involved (ex. socratic seminars, debates). I absolutely despise sports. I’m not good at sports at all. I used to run track as a kid and I hated it. In middle school, I tried going to the gym and it ended up being a source of anxiety and stress. I hate moving my body and wasting my time doing something that’s painful 3 days a week. I also don’t really like outdoor activities, they all seem pretty exhausting. Indoors activities are way better, as long as I don’t have to move my body. • How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate? I’m quite curious but it depends on the topic. My interest is very black and white, I’ll either be obsessed with something and ask a thousand questions about it or I won’t care about it at all. I don’t really have any ideas I’d like to execute, since my brain finds more cons than pros in any idea, that usually makes my interest go away. My curiosities are usually about things I don’t understand, but they extend to every field, not just things I’m interested in. Ex.: I don’t care about airplanes, but how do pilots not get lost in the sky? After I ask myself a question, I make a bet with myself: I try to arrive to the answer by myself and then check if it’s right. Whenever it’s right, I feel really good about myself. I don’t know if my curiosities are more environmental than conceptual, I think it’s a 50/50. • Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be? I don’t think i’d enjoy it. I tried some times in the past, but no one ever listens to me so I instantly give up. It’s quite embarrassing. I’d probably be pretty bad at it, since I don’t really care about my duties. I’d get stressed out quickly. • Are you coordinated? Why do you feel as if you are or are not? Do you enjoy working with your hands in some form? Describe your activity? I’m not coordinated at all. I’m bad at sports,dancing and playing musical instruments. I feel like I’m bad at activities that require coordination because certain skills need months of practice before they can be acquired and if I’m not immediately good at something, then I’ll lose all interest. The only practical thing I like doing is cooking, but I do it very rarely out of fear that what I’ll cook will turn out badly. • Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particularly artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer. I’m not artistic at all. As I said in the last answer, certain skills need months of practice and I don’t have the patience for that. I admit I used to be more artistically inclined as a kid, I was obsessed with arts and crafts. I also used to draw digitally (I can't anymore). I enjoy fan arts of my favourite fictional characters and pictures of places (cities, rivers etc…) . I also enjoy pictures of sea creatures, I think they’re the most aesthetically pleasing animals to look at. Of course dogs and cats are nice too, but I wouldn’t put a picture of them on my wall. • What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them? The past is what I think about more often, I’m sure I remember 90% of my life. I always treated the present about something that needs to pass, I feel like I’ve always been waiting for something that will never come. The future is weird to me , I haven’t lived it yet so I only feel crippling anxiety towards it. I always feel like I might lose everything at any moment,that’s why I'm scared of the future, but I try to not think about it. • How do you act when others request your help to do something (anything)? If you would decide to help them, why would you do so? I only help people who are my friends only because I don’t want to lose them or have them be mad at me. I hate helping people, though. So I do it half-assedly (don’t know if this is a word lol). • Do you need logical consistency in your life? Yes, I think. I won't elaborate on this because I don't really understand this question. • How important is efficiency and productivity to you? It's very important. I would feel like a failure if I didn't fulfill my duties. Whenever I'm not productive I get very depressed. But on the other hand, I also hate having to do things all the time, so everything is stressful. • Do you control others, even if indirectly? How and why do you do that? No, I don't care about controlling others. I don't even know what I would gain from that, honestly. • What are your hobbies? Why do you like them? This is a tough question, because I don't have any hobbies. I just scroll on social media all day until I fall asleep. Sometimes I get fixated on games or animes, but other than that I don't do much. • What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses? I hate forced learning. Usually my method is: I don't do anything til the last minute,if I have a test. If there will be no tests, then it's guaranteed I will never study that topic. I struggle with teachers who don't explain things clearly, no matter how many times you ask them to repeat themselves. I also hate being in groups, it really annoys me. Whenever in class there's people with their desks too close to mine it literally freaks me out, I can't learn that way. The only classes that seem fun are the ones where I can talk (in my case philosophy and English) and be the one “dominating” the group conversation with the teacher and the class. I don't know what they classify as, out of those in the question. I think memorization would be the best option. Although I don't mean memorization of verb conjugations and all that stuff. Just general memorization. • How good are you at strategizing? Do you easily break up projects into manageable tasks? Or do you have a tendency to wing projects and improvise as you go? I'm actually good at strategizing and making plans. The problem is, I never have any motivation to follow through with those plans. So inevitably, I have to improvise. • What are your aspirations in life, professionally and personally? I have no idea. I'll probably be a teacher because it seems like the easiest thing. Honestly, I just want to have a stable income and live in a nice house by myself. • What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why? My rational fears are becoming homeless and having my family die while I'm still young. My irrational fears are plants and ugly paintings of people. I also have trypophobia. Physical contact and having people in my personal space make me very uncomfortable. I hate about 90% of the things that exist. To make it short, what I hate the most is being forced to do things I don't want. • What do the \"highs\" in your life look like? Vacations and not having any responsibilities. Good food and good friends around me. • What do the \"lows\" in your life look like? Too many responsibilities, having everyone around me in a bad mood and things not going the way I want. • How attached are you to reality? Do you daydream often, or do you pay attention to what's around you? If you do daydream, are you aware of your surroundings while you do so? I daydream about 80% of the time. I'm still aware of my surroundings even if I'm completely zoned out. I daydream while I'm walking, while I'm in class, while I'm in bed etc… I'm almost never in touch with reality. • Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about? I daydream about my meticulously crafted mental universe. It's really fun. • How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it? Usually the right answer will come right before I need to make that decision, but if I think about it too soon I won't have the right answer. I don't know, it depends. Sometimes I do change my mind after, but most times I don't. • How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life? I don't know. I act very impulsively and then forget about what I did. My mood doesn't change often, but sometimes I have outbursts of random crying. I don't process this kind of stuff. • Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going? How often? Why? No, I usually just leave the conversation if I don't agree with someone. I don't think it's worth it to confront them about it. • Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged, or that they know better? If you do break rules, why? I don't have any rules to break,so I don't. Also yes, authority should be challenged but I'm not going to be the one who challenges them.Unearned income CALIFORNIA I got a letter that says that since i get Calfresh I must report within 10 days when my total income reaches a certain level. My IRT is 1396 and they stated total income includes both earned and unearned. I do not work and I only get money from my parents to pay for rent, utilities, gas since I am away from them for school and I am wondering if the $2000 given to me by my parents counts as unearned income. I live by myself and my base rent is $1653 and then additional utility fee + gas for car. I reported that my mom gives me $2000 for rent and utilities + gas on my application when I applied and provided proof and got approved so I am confused as to why my IRT is $1396 and having to call them now. Thank you! Does money from parents count as unearned income? Why is my IRT 1396 when I got approved after telling them and providing proof that I receive $2000 from my parents for rent, utilities, and gas?All my friends get frustrated and angry with me, & I'm not really sure why. Me and my friends have been planning a day trip recently and I was checking up on this tonight, Then I get a text from my friend saying that we have to postpone it to the next day, and that my other friend would not be staying over on the night of the trip, because of an issue with my him friend, so I go and check on him and ask him why we needed to postpone and why I can't stay over, them he says there been an accident and he cant talk, well I could tell he was online so if there was an accident he still wouldn't be on his phone, and then he says he's walking his buddy home, and there was an accident but he refused to tell me why, so I asked again and she said he was just messing around, well, I wanted to check up on him again and he wasn't responding, so I got really anxious and mad because I could see he was reading my messages, so then I said that if he really cared about me, he would tell me what was going on instead of ignoring me on purpose, and then he tells me; \"You need to stop centering your trauma around your friends, stop texting me\" So I start getting confused and asked him what I did to upset him, and he stops responding. This isn't the first time its happened, and for some reason things like this only happen when friend1 is around him, whom I mentioned in the start, but friend1 only wants to see friend2 and me when I am visiting friend2, despite his parents telling me they thought friend1 brought out the worst in him, and they didn't like her, I agree with them because friend1 has used him for money a lot of times and she sometimes turns him against me. I talked to my parents about this, and they said I was too available and had to let them ask me to hang out first, but I really don't know how, I am also worried our entire day trip has been cancelled because of this, what did I do wrong? How can I be better? What should I say to make them forgive me? (Keep in mind friend2 is autistic and has adhd like me, but sometimes I still feel so different which doesn't make sense because we are very similar thinkers)Valentine’s Day was just ruined for me I’ve never received any valentines cards from anybody except my parents, so you can imagine my shock when I opened my locker at school and found a note with a heart on it. Well you probably think that it was something nice right? Wrong. It was a note specifically stating I was “Ugly as shit” with the persons initials on it, trouble is, I could not find the person who wrote it. I was embarrassed and disappointed for the rest of the day but pretended like I was fine and acted like I hadn’t received anything from anyone, I didn’t want the person who wrote that note to get what they wanted. They wrote that note knowing damn well it was going to hurt a lot. What tf is wrong with peopleYou took my close friend away from me, You used to be nice, why do you act the way you do? I have this close friend, for privacy reasons we’ll call her Bob, recently, Bob found my TikTok account by accident and she told everyone I know, my account is personal and frankly I don’t want any people I know knowing about it, she always gets me in trouble for no reason, she’s a pick me girl who gets away with everything, I hate being around her, she’s changed, she fakes depression and most likely other things too, she treats me like I’m a roach, she never makes an effort when she talks to me, but I can’t drop her because she’s friends with one of my closest friends, and she’d most likely tell her mother if I tried to tell her how I feel, and I’d be the one getting in trouble.I don’t know if I was in my body I was basically meditating for a while, listening to ap music, when I peeked through my eyelids…. It looked as if everything was black and white, it felt fuzzy….. like I was still inside of my body but something didn’t feel right, like I was sleeping but something else, everything looked rippled and I just lay still, I don’t think I could have flown or moved around, from what I could see it still appeared that I was in my physical body…. But it looked more ghost like and I felt somewhat calmer, is this normal for a beginner? Will I gain the ability to move freely out of my body and be able to traverse to other planets? Why didn’t I just fly out of my body all at once? Why did it feel that way?New to this sub Ok, so I recently discovered astral projection through TikTok, while I still don’t really understand it, I want to learn how to do it, I have a few questions about it tho: 1: Are you a ghost when you astral project yourself? Can dead spirits see you? Is your soul being ejected out of your body? 2: Is it actually real, or just a very vivid lucid dream? 3: How do you re-enter your body when you’re finished? 4: Does it feel realistic? Or fuzzy, like a dream perhaps. 5: If I’m a Christian, can I take part in the act? Or is it seen as “Satanic”. 6: Can a non spiritual human see your soul while you are in the state of astral projection?What's wrong with me? I'm 13 years old. My mother got diagnosed with cancer when I was ten, but I didn't think much about until it became terminal, now I'm constantly paranoid every day and I don't know why, The only people I really have now is my father and sister, I have relatives who are decently close to me but they are very religious and I feel as if they wouldn't understand me as much as my mother does, she pisses me off sometimes but what I don't realize is that she's more close to me than anybody in my life has ever been, she always cared about me, spoiled me and showed me affection when I needed it most. Sometimes, I have random visions of me losing my mind and becoming a murderous psychopath, I'm pretty sure there's no chance of this in real life happening obviously, but my paranoia plays into this and I get scared for no reason and start questioning if I'm going to grow up and have a good life. Recently I've been wishing death upon myself and others, but I take it back after a short period of time because I realized its wrong and I shouldn't get worked up over small things, And I'm scared that as a punishment, the things I say will come true, I desperately need reassurance that its not true and nothing bad will happen to anyone or anything I love. I don't know what to doWhat Is My Acc Worth?

I don't go first because last week I was supposed to get mermaid halo 2021, in return of my princess alexis, but they scammed me, I also only have proofs of people scamming me, so I don't know how to get my first proof, I hope I can find somebody to trust me, you can also record to make sure that if I did scam, you could have pure evidence that I did, and i'd probably get banned. I don't have the toy yet, but Its going to arrive to my house on sunday (Sydney Time) I'm really hoping my toy isn't a scam, but if it is, I will notify you asap. My discord tag is #6402, so you can dm me if you want Also, before the trade, I must see your halo to make sure its not exploited, otherwize I could get my rh account deleted. Sorry about the flair, I couldn't find the right one I can also add bahia's pacifier, and 190k, and like I said before, Idc which halo it is, but Preferably halloween 2020 or spring 2020 :DTime seems to be... stopping? So I have had a problem where basically time freezes, and I cant interact with people and objects, but My animations are completely fine with the glitter from my outfit working fine and my halos are moving too like normal, It happens in sunset island and the trading hub, idk if it happens in other realms but I don't think so, its usually these two realms specifically, and the time freezing glitch happens within 10 minutes of going into the game, it is not happening with other games, just Royale High so far, I want it gone I wanna play normal for once (The glitch does not happen on mobile)Contribution of Internet usage to ADHD and ASD. It’s been on my mind for a little while now that my Internet, and specifically social media usage has gone up drastically in the past 2-3 years. I’m a female in my early twenties, recently diagnosed with high functioning ASD, starting to realize that I also have pretty clear symptoms of ADHD. I haven’t been officially diagnosed with ADHD, but I think after laying out the changes that occurred to my behavior and habits in the past 3 years I can only assume there has to be a connection. Is it something that Internet can cause and form, or do you think it has always been there and technology just contributed, thus enhanced it? What is your personal experience with existing ADHD or recently “appeared” ADHD symptoms?Looking for working/sporting canine community, rescue community. Hello! I’m a professional canine & pet photographer from Virginia, moving to Tucson, AZ early November. I donate my services to rescues & shelters – pointandhowl.com. Please let me know if you can help with networking or pass on my information if you’re volunteering with a rescue or animal shelter. We also own a dog, Ava is our PSDiT, 1 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, she is a 3 month old puppy on the image below. We’d love to connect with other bird dog owners and sporting/working dog owners in AZ. I’m involved into rescue community in VA and would love to continue contributing my part in AZ. Would appreciate some recommendations on dog trainers in Tucson area. Preferably R+. Thanks so much.Seeking Greyhound & horse racing misconceptions, education and facts. Curious to learn more about greyhound & horse racing. I’m meeting a lot of people in a vegan community that are against greyhound & horse racing, and I’m genuinely not understanding what is wrong with it. Now, I understand the abuse can be found in any sporting or working dog community, but that’s dependable on a human that works the animal(s). Same with any typical dog owner. I see (I’m sure you do too) so many “dog lovers” that neglect and abuse their dog because they’re not educated enough, or not dedicated enough, while they vote against activiets that dogs were bred to do and enjoy most. I’d love to hear facts about greyhound racing, horse racing that you believe are positive and things that could be changed to a better. I personally against any violence, abuse and neglect, I advocate for responsible animal ownership, and I love the idea of giving the animal an opportunity to work and do what they were bred for, what they enjoy doing and I simply do not understand how people can be against something that makes the animal happy. I was once attacked by another vegan when I shared the fact that my dog (hunting breed) is worked as a service animal and I was accused in exploiting her for my own purposes and benefits. These are exactly the people that get vegans bad reputation.Service animal in training distracted by public is actually a good thing. I myself used to complain and get pissed off at people who see my dog with a service vest on, patched with “no eye contact, no petting, in work” and yell “what a pretty puppy” in child’s voice. I used to get furious and even became slightly rude to those who do that. However, after a couple months of work, I changed my opinion. Exactly those people who do not realize that they’re distracting an animal from work ARE making the dog focus more on the handler, and less reactive towards distractions. It is a great challenge for those that have already achieved something in training and are able to not react as fast. Of course it depends on the age of your dog, temperament, and amount of work you put it in training. A fresh puppy that put the vest on only yesterday obviously will be distractive and alert, but after some time they become more tolerant.

Her gf keeps like febreeze bombing the house saying cause my room stinks . My sister tho I never seen spraying febreeze or anything. My room supposedly has such a nasty smell that less then 5 mins door open my room stinks up the house . Ok tho I’m home all day with my sister, in and out my room and not once did she light a candle or spray a febreeze . Her gf will walk out their room to use the bathroom and febreeze up the bathroom then go back in her room. She’s not even like walking around the house . She purposely steps out to spray febreeze . I hate this bitch. I don’t live like a pig or nothing foul .Housing problems My sister/roommate just told me shes moving out & this whole time I thought we had resigned a lease . While I know now that we did not or at least I did not literally sign a lease again . I didn’t know how it worked and I trusted my sister with the process I’m still new to this shit and I’m not the best with looking up information. I learn best from Actions and conversations & seeing that it’s my sister I just thought she’d explain and it would tell me complete information not half of it which is that she told me we were signing a lease again and we literally have to sign again . I know Im the dumb one ig but yeah I’d would have tried to save my money knowing that i could leave and get a new place anytime. I have a dog and am fucking stressed about finding a new apartment for my pup and I . Wish me luck.Need a pat on my back something I’m having a hard time Living with my sister . We are both adults and yet I feel like I get treated like shit . I tried to finally speak up for something I didn’t like ( I’ve been waiting for a while on the specific problem) when I did she lashed out on me and begin to talk down to me . I understand her pov but yeah for the whole 7-8 months we’ve been on a lease together she just complains about me and my pov on that is I’m tryin honestly I’m not doing foul shit it just typical living stuff . I always knew it would be tick for tat if I spoke up so I never did . Since I’ve been living here I’ve been having mental health issues and I don’t wanna say suicidal but yeah that’s how I kinda feel and in general just really hate life . Again I never felt like this before I always had is rough from my pov but lately because it’s a problem with a family my only sister I feel like I have no one. This is ruining my life I feel . I’m a grown man getting bullied by his big sister still shits weak .Feeling lonely TL/DR I feel like I’m just having a moment idk Man I’m just super distant guy , I have 2 older siblings and a cool family background but in general nobody showed me what feels like attention. It feels like as a kid I just went to school and ate dinner and repeated that process . Family events were pretty wack to me cause I had no cousins my age or anyone I was “close” with . Now that I’m older and what feel like I’ve been independent my whole life up (23m), that schedule of work and home is now all I know . I don’t go out to the family events because Im not comfortable around them . Like im at someone else house or some ya know ? I share living arrangements with my older sister and I thought moving in a place together would bring us closer but it just feels like she doesn’t really fwm either & I get it everyone has a life & problems and stuff so being home I see it all the real . She hangs out with our other brother tho and it’s bunk cause I don’t get invited out to those moments either . It’s not no crazy family problems or nothing im just having a hard time finding my place I guess.Dumb ass manager TL/DR I guess I’m new to this stuff. My manager hella funny acting , talking out his ass sometimes. My co worker stole something from me and to keep it short nothing happened because if there’s no proof whatever . I told him he was a piece of shit and it was the end of it . I’m not going let this broke dude have me feeling like I can’t come to work and get paid when he can barely even show up to his shift . Idgaf tho I ain’t the boss , that’s his business. I worked 2 days back to back (my last 2 out of my 5 day week) by myself in the store. That’s pretty much a full 8 hours of customer service. Today the thief was my relief i guess really he just comes in when I leave, but being by myself I have to wait for this mf to clock in and ect. Yeah though I did a 8 barely a 20 minute break on my Friday and at my clock out time exactly I him I’m bouta leave . This mf had the nerve to say “hey I know your trying to avoid him but can you stay a few min?” nah fuck that dude cmon now maybe if I didn’t do a 8 with no break , maybe if I was cool with guy I’d cover him for the minutes their late but nah. On top that it’s my Friday I have a life , mf problems . I’m trying get tf outta here fuck these customers . I told him in a causal way he had me messed up and Idgaf bout seeing this guybut if I don’t have to see his dumb ass it’s a bonus.Typical life shit My parents were addicts and my grandparents only gave me a roof over my head it feels like . Once I graduated Hs turned 18 I’ve been working and paying for most stuff myself . Went off to school because my older brother convinced me , left my grandparents house doing so but I left college because I was stressed about not being able to financially support myself. It’s been 3-4 years Since then it feels like I haven’t experienced life because all I know now is bills and trying to “survive” ya know adult shit . It just overall sucks Ik it’s reality but when I look at the people around me they all got to ease into supporting themselves and becoming a adult just feeling like me tho I been with the sharks even before 18. All I fear is being homeless because I don’t have that safety net or really any safety net . If I don’t make something happen nothing will ya know .I think Shane has pretty severe internalized homophobia. He takes it out on Ryland. Anyone else notice this? I don’t watch or support either of them. But I do watch Nick DiRamio’s clip breakdowns. He’s talked about Shane videos a few times. I remember in one that he showed some weird ass stuff Shane was saying about Ryland (this was a semi-recent vlog. Was from this year). He was making comments about how he had dreams that Ryland had a vagina and how great it was. And I think he made comments about Ryland being the “woman in the relationship”. I remember there being something else but I don’t have the specifics since I watched this video a while ago This made me so uncomfortable? It makes me wonder if Shane is just very internally homophobic and takes it out on Ryland. Or maybe even if Shane realized he wasn’t into men (or at least just Ryland) or something. It would make sense to say he’s maybe not attracted to Ryland since it’s been quite a while since they got engaged, and I’m pretty sure Shane has openly expressed doubts Idk. This all just makes me feel weird and I’m curious what other people thinkCan you need glasses even if you can see fine? I think I can see fine. But I wonder if maybe I am just used to straining my eyes. It’s just that everytime I look at my phone or laptop I will get a headache within 15min. I tried blue light glasses for a while but those made it worse because the lenses would slightly change my eyesight for some reason. I usually just keep my phone in nightmode so it has the yellow screen tint I haven’t had my eyes tested really. Other than just the thing where you cover one eye and read stuff on the poster. And I always pass that. I don’t know if I’m just stupid or if it’s possible I would need glasses lolllll EDIT: I’m scheduling an appointment to get my eyes checked on Monday!I may have inhaled one of the balls on my nose ring… what should I do? I’m not fully sure if I did. But I was out today, and I had rubbed my nose at some point and felt there was something in it. But I assumed it was dried snot or something and so I just continued on. I didn’t stop to look or anything When I got home I realized one of the balls on my nose ring was gone. It falls off all the time because I’m bad at screwing it on lol so I wasn’t surprised. But I remembered feeling the thing in my nose and it scared me a bit Anyone know what to do?? It’s entirely possible it fell onto the ground, but if it didn’t… what do I do? For reference, it’s tiny. It’s a standard nose ring ball. It’s also made of metalHer not buying used books pisses me off way more than it should lol For reference, I work in a non-profit used book store. Let me tell you… we only put the best books on sale. You know how many hours I have spent sorting books, picking up books covered in mold and mysterious stains? Those books aren’t the ones being sold!!! If they’re ok enough quality, they’re sold wholesale, but if they’re really bad we will toss them. Then, once we’ve weeded out the disgusting books (we also don’t sell library books so we sell those wholesale too but that is beside the point) we will sort through the books and find only good quality/relevant ones. Books with writing in them? Nope! Books with torn covers? Nope! Etc The process of sorting out books is so long. We then give our managers the bucket of books and they will sort through them again. We only sell what the managers deem good. We also would sanitize our books when Covid was bad… which took forever All in all, it pisses me off that she is acting so against using second hand items. She’s not the one who has to touch nasty stuff Also! The whole “what if someone used the bathroom while reading this?!?” Makes no sense. Does she not realize that book stores like barnes and noble often have restrooms too? Which would mean people could use the bathroom, not wash their hands and then poke around at the books. And, at least for me, I take public transit to get to the bookstore. So my hands are covered in germs when I go through the books I wanna buy. Idk why this comment irritated me so much but uhhhhh yeah thought it’d be cool to give you gorls some insightI almost enjoy having a sunburn. My back really hurts and I feel I deserve it… a big part of me wants to go back out tomorrow and fall asleep outside as punishment. Pls help I’m a few months clean from cutting but I keep finding myself doing self destructive things and I think it’s self harm? My friends and I went to the beach, and they helped me put sunscreen on my back but they did a horrible job and my back is in pretty bad pain (I’m very pale and burn easy). I almost am glad it happened though? I feel I deserve it because I felt like I was being annoying today. And a big part of me wants to go out tomorrow and lay in the sun and burn more. Really the only thing keeping me from doing so is the idea of skin cancer. But I’m curious if this sounds like self harm?? I have other behaviors like this— skin picking, hair pulling, scalp itching, hitting myself in the head etc— and I can’t tell if im unintentionally self harmingHaving to watch my brother who has… something? I can’t tell if he’s lying to me. But feeling insanely triggered pls help He (10) has had d* for a few days now. It’s worse in the morning too. He’s felt n* every morning. This morning he came into my room and said “I almost t*u* this morning so can I stay home again?” I didn’t know what to do and just told him yes. My dad isn’t home (he never is bc he would rather be at his girlfriends house…) so I (18, just had my last day of high school on Friday) have to do everything. I thought it would be nice to have this week to myself since my siblings are still in school but NO they’re both home and I HAVE TO take care of them. I can’t tell if my brother is lying though? He knows that this is one of, if not my absolute biggest trigger. He knows I will believe him. But if he’s not lying then what? He doesn’t wash his hands (no one other than me does in my house) so he’s spreading it everywhere. Idk. I am just feeling freaked out. I really just can’t fo this. I cried last night, woke up multiple times, and I have no appetite. Please someone help I don’t know what to do. Quick TW for SH and suicide for this last part: I have almost relapsed again because of this. And have seriously considered going back into inpatient because if I get s* I will actually seriously kill myself. I don’t know what to do and I’m scared. This phobia is ruining my life and I really can’t deal with it anymoreCan’t do it anymore. Living with constant triggers, meds don’t work. Am always getting worse. Might just end it Yeah. Just finished high school, graduation is next week. Will live it out til then but probably am done after that. So fuxking tired of this. Prozac and Zoloft haven’t worked for me, my psychiatrist hates me and never remembers when our appointments are, my therapist just graduated college so I can’t see her anymore, and I’m living with constant triggers. I am so tired of trying. I told myself I needed to make it through high school, and I did. And I feel this is a good stopping point. Not sure how I’ll do it but it’ll likely be before the end of the month tbh. I just can’t do this anymore.Looking for an inexpensive eye glaze! Preferably one I could buy in person. Any recs? My prom is on Friday and I decided I really wanna wear makeup. I think an eye glaze would look so so good. Either green, brown, or white/offwhite (those are the colors I’m going for with my outfit). I’m wondering if anyone has recommendations? Preferably something inexpensive as I do not make a lot of money + I won’t wear it much after prom is over. And if it’s in an in person store that would be helpful! For reference, I’m in Boston, MA which is in the US :•]I smell smoke all the time, even when it’s not there. I feel like I’m losing my mind I smell smoke most nights, usually just in my bedroom. I always go and check around the house to make sure nothing is burning. I then check in the back hallways to see if my neighbors are smoking weed out there (they do that sometimes) but there’s never anyone out there. My family never smells it. Sometimes I’ll smell it during the day/ in other places, but my bedroom and at night are most common. And sometimes I smell things that aren’t smoke— most commonly gas (like from the stove) or cat urine (I have cats) Tonight I can’t get the smell of cigarettes out of my nose. I don’t smoke, but my dad does. He does it in the house sometimes. So I went and asked if he had smoked at all within the last hour or so and he said no. I checked around the apartment and looked to see if my neighbors were there. There’s nothing It’s really stressing me out though because I’m scared something is burning and I can’t find it. I should also add that sometimes I see smoke/haze while smelling it?? Not puffs of smoke, more like the rooms in my apartment look foggy and hazy. Again, no one else in my family has ever noticed it What’s going on? Is there a way to fix this? It makes me really anxious. I don’t know if it’s a medical thing or maybe a mental health thing? Please help EDIT: I now am smelling blood along with a mild cigarette smell. This is really sketching me out as this has never been something I’ve smelled randomly. I do not have a nose bleed and am not bleeding at allJust re-started taking Motegrity again today after a few weeks being off. Within like 30 mins I had extreme diarrhea- and still am. Is this normal? As the title says, I just restarted my meds. I was off them for about a week because I had a procedure. It took a while to get back on them, because I ran out and my doctors were being annoying about filling my prescription. Finally got the refill though I took at around 10am this morning, then by like 10:30 I was already on the toilet. It wasn’t really diarrhea, more so just soft. Parts of it had blood in it, but that’s become normal for me now (it wasn’t from a fissure because I’m in no pain) It’s now 11:30. I have used the bathroom about 6 times and can tell I will need to keep going. As I went more and more, it became pure water. A few bits floating in it, but basically water The first round smelled kinda bitter but it was fine. As I’ve gone more and more, it’s become very sour. I’m wondering if maybe it’s just bile? It’s very yellow too. So far I’ve lost .7lb and it’s only been an hour since taking the meds. I’m just confused because I don’t think it is supposed to work that fast Just wondering if this sounds normal?? Or should I be concernedFreaking out. May get kicked out after graduation if I’m outed as trans. Needing advice ASAP I’m 18, and my last day of high school is next Friday. And my graduation is on the 13th. I’m out as trans at school, and to my friends (my friends parents know too) but am not out at home because my dad will very likely kick me out if he learns about it I was going to just tell my school to put my legal name on my diploma and to call my legal name. I thought that would be fine. But I’m realizing that if my family talks to any of my friends parents, they will find out I’m trans I will tell my friends parents to not talk to my family, and if they do to please use my legal name. But I know they’ll slip up What do I do??? I am freaking out. I don’t know where I would go. I don’t start college til September so I would need somewhere to stay until then. Honestly am thinking of lying and saying I have Covid so I don’t have to attend graduation. That way my family won’t find out. It sucks though because I want to go Please helpPretty bad wrist/finger pain. Carpal tunnel maybe?? Feeling concerned bc this may ruin my job I am a freelance artist, and I recently started working in a bookstore part time to save up for college (I am graduating high school in 2 weeks). I am also a visual arts major at my high school, and plan to pursue art in college I’m scared though. Today is the worst it’s ever been. Having extremely bad wrist pain, as well as finger pain. Almost feels like my hand is full of blood or something, even though it’s not swollen at all. It feels tight and achy and nothing is helping. Using my hand sends somewhat shooting pains from my wrist into my hand/fingers (mostly my thumb or pinky + ring finger) I put away books on our shelves for basically 8 hours straight today. And I spent a few hours drawing yesterday as I usually do It’s apparently really common for the visual art majors to develop carpel tunnel before graduation at my school. And I think my new job is making it worse I’m freaking out bc I am afraid I may have carpal tunnel. I don’t know what to do, because it will effect all of my life plans/ I will possibly have to quit my job. Does anyone have thoughts??? Does this sound like carpal tunnel? And what can I do about it?Feeling stressed tonight and am struggling with the fear of “something” happening. Please help I don’t even really know what that “something” is… I have OCD and sometimes when I am going through a lot (as I am now) it acts up. I am afraid to go to sleep and I feel like I have to wait until I can see the sun. This used to happen a lot but it’s not very frequent anymore. I have school tomorrow (today??) and have to be up in 2 and a half hours. But I’m just freaking out over stuff that I KNOW is irrational Not sure what to do. Anyone have tips/ideas? Should I just stay up all night? I am too scared to sleep rn. My apartment is too silent but also I’m too nervous to play any noise out loudI CANNOT DEAL WITH THIS ANYMORE… it just keeps getting worse and I feel like I’m losing my mind Before I continue I just wanna put a big TW for suicide, self harm, abuse, and just general depression and anxiety stuff. I don’t know if a post like this is even allowed here, so I am sorry to the mods if I have broken the rules. It’s ok if you need to delete this I’m so so sick of this. I don’t understand how I keep getting worse? The past 2 days have genuinely been living hell. I feel so goddamn nauseous all the time. Yesterday I think I actually almost fainted while using the bathrooms. It’s so weird. I’m constipated (I have IBS-C) but my stool isn’t even always solid!! Yesterday it was soft but was still somewhat hard to push out. And even then, I was in EXTREME pain. My lower back hurt, it felt like my insides would fall out of my ass, my stomach was cramping horribly. And I felt so nauseous. And the pain made the nausea worse.Today hasn’t been much better. I still feel dizzy, still super nauseous regardless of what I eat/if I don’t eat, and I just can’t do this. I seriously just want to die at this point, to be honest. I don’t understand why things just keep getting worse. My doctors do not care. My family does not care. My friends do not take my seriously. Every day I wake up and dread having to eat. I’ve been dealing with this for about 4 years (so since I was about 14. I am 18 now) and it’s ruined high school for me. Along with my disgustingly horrible mental health, and living with my abuser, my IBS has made it so hard to exist. I hate leaving my house in case I have a flare up of pain. I don’t go out to eat. I skip school multiple times a week. ended up relapsing a few weeks ago after being 2 years clean of self harm. A significant part of why I relapsed was because of how much constant pain I am in with my IBS. I can’t take it anymore and no one in my life takes me seriously since the illness won’t kill me. It’s morbid and gross for me to say, but sometimes I just wish I had cancer or something so that people would stop treating me like a baby and actually acknowledge that this is causing issues for me. I don’t really know what to do. As I write this, it’s past 2 am. I am awake because I am extremely nauseous and so I can’t sleep even though I’m exhausted. If I don’t get things settled soon I genuinely don’t know if I can even go on because this is ruining my life more and more and more each day. I don’t understand what I did to deserve this. I don’t know why the universe has decided to punish me. I am so lost. I am about to graduate high school and I have been seriously contemplating just not going. I have 2 weeks left. I just wanna stay home and be done. I don’t care if I don’t graduate. I don’t care if I get kicked from the college I’m set to go to next year. I feel like shit. And I’m tired of putting in effort just for life to come around and kick me in the ass again. What’s the point in trying if it’ll forever be getting worse?? I am probably the most depressed I’ve ever been— which is saying a lot considering I have 2 past attempts of suicide under my belt.. I just give up j think. I give up on trying to fix this. I give up on seeing my doctors anymore. I give up on going to work and to school and maintaining relationships. I am just so exhausted man. And I know I am sounding very “boo-hoo feel sorry for me” right now. I am sorry for that. I just needed a space to share this because no one in my life cares. And the few that have any care do not understand what I mean. Not expecting anyone to have read this far but if you did, thank youFriend complaining about v*ing— now saying their family is also n*. I am freaking out please please help My friend apparently v*ed in school. I thought it was due to his reflux but no. He was joking after and saying “damn it’s funny that that just hapoened because I’m not even having reflux or anything” Now he’s texting our group chat saying that there might be something going around his house because other family members he lives with feel n* too He said it could be just from the heat but said maybe not and he doesn’t know/care I was next to him a lot of the day. I don’t put my hands in my eyes/mouth while I’m out in public bc I feel safer having them washed. And I had my mask on all day. But I am terrified right now. I am so scared that I’ll get whatever they have. I don’t know what to do. Do you guys think I’ll be ok? And how long would it take for me to feel symptoms???An update: I have an anorectal manometry tomorrow… but I just got my period out of the blue. Am I still good to have the procedure done? I wasn’t expecting to get my period, because I’m on depo shots and rarely get any sort of break through bleeding. But OF COURSE I got it today, lol. I think it’s from stress/ straining to use the bathroom (I’m off all my meds til after the procedure so my constipation has been extra bad). I’m just wondering if I’m still able to have the procedure done tomorrow even if I’m bleeding? I can’t put in a tampon because it causes a lot of pain, so I worry about bleeding on the table or somethingFeeling extremely nervous for anorectal manometry :•( needing support I have one scheduled for Thursday, as well as an EGD + impedance study (I think it’s just an upper endoscopy + they leave this tube down my nose and in my stomach for 24hrs to test acid levels). I AM FREAKING OUT…. I thought I would be asleep fot the AM!! But I was watching videos about it and I’m apparently awake for it!! Like, fully awake! Is there anyway they can give me something for anxiety before hand? And like… should I shave?? I wasn’t going to because I thought I’d be asleep and I could pretend it didn’t happen. But since I’m gonna be awake I’m feeling soooo insecure… I know they’re medical professionals and they don’t care probably but I just am so nervous. I never shave my ass/ genitals really bc I’m bad at it and always get cuts from it. But I’m wondering if I should shave for this… And like… is it possible I’ll shit myself during it? I have to do an enema the night before but what if that doesn’t clear me out fully? How do I know I am fully clear? Because if I’m not clear 100% I’m scared I’ll go accidentally during the test. Idk. Im just really feeling freaked out about this all. They didn’t tell me I would be awake for it. If anyone has had this done/ has tips to help me pls lemme knowHow does mandated reporting work once you’re no longer a minor? Quick TW for suicide + self harm + hospitalization, though nothing explicit Hey all, I need some help. I would ask my therapist/ psychiatric abt this but I don’t want to be obvious. How does mandated reporting work now that I’m 18? Before, they told my dad the time I told them I was suicidal + self harming. I ended up being hospitalized because I had a past attempt from like 3-4 years before as well, so I think they considered me high risk or something. I’ve never stopped being suicidal though, it’s just more passive (most of the time). And I recently relapsed after being about 2yrs clean. I want to mention this to my health team, as I think I need support for it. And they ask me about my safety everytime I see them but I always lie. I’m just concerned though that they may call an emergency contact or put me back into inpatient again if I tell them what’s going on So, does anyone know how this works?? I don’t want my family finding out about this, because my father will yell at me and may kick me out again (I just turned 18 in Dec, and will be moving out in the fall for college) :•(Constant ice pick headaches ruining my life. Idk what to do Idk if this is the right sub. But I have ice pick headaches every single day. Thought it was normal til recently. Everyday, without fail, I’ll get a stabbing pain or two or three (usually in my temple area) every few hours. I can ignore it and pretend it doesn’t happen But days like today, it’s unbearable. It’s been going on since 10am this morning (it’s now like 1:20am..) it’s only on there right side of my temple today. Though theres a tiny spot right on the top of my head, on the right side of my middle part, that also hurts. But it almost feels like the siz of a pin needle or something. Usually every few minutes one will happen, but then I’ll get an attack of them where it feels almost nonstop for 1-2min. I feel it in my ears and my teeth and it genuinely feels like I’m being stabbed The side of my head almost feels bruised. If I rub my temple it hurts a little. I’ve been trying to just sleep all day, because then I can ignore it. And I found that keeping my head fully still helped. Even in the moments where it doesn’t hurt, my entire skull feels heavy I really just do not know what to even do. I took Tylenol, I slept, I tried a shower then an ice pack then a hot pack. I drank water and ate food. Nothing is helping Please. I am so exhausted and I just wanna go to sleep. If someone can please tell me what to do to help this even just a little, I would be so gratefulCleaned all the dirty dishes out from my room! And am in the process of cleaning the rest of my room :•) It’s been… months since I cleaned. I had a cup in my room from January. I think today I cleaned out like…20 or so dishes? Depression is one hell of an illness, hey? But the warmer weather has brought my spirits up somewhat (still a struggle to do anything. But it’s somewhat improved) and I’m excited because my sister is coming home next week!! Feeling proud of myself for working on bettering myself even while my illness is making it feel impossibleIs it bad that I almost hope that I have something more serious than IBS-C? I feel guilty I was diagnosed over a year ago w IBS-C. Now, after months of trying to convince my doctor, I’m finally getting testing done to make sure it isn’t a structural issue/blockage. They never did any sort of lower GI testing on me, and would just switch me around on meds (linzess, Motegrity) to fix the issue. But it still hasn’t resolved, not with those meds or with the ridiculous amount of other meds I take (I also have GERD and take 40mg of omeprazole 2x a day, Cyproheptadine 4mg 1x a day) nothing has worked as far as medication goes, so doesn’t it make sense to assume it could be a structural or blockage issue? A weird part of me hopes I’m right, and hopes there’s something really wrong. Worse than IBS-C. It’s bad fo say but I almost hope they find something bad and then have to feel guilty for brushing me off for the past 3-4yrs I’ve been seeing them. Is this bad to think? I obviously would love if they found a super simple fix and I was better and could be normal again, but idk. I think I’m just petty lol, but I’m curious if any of you have felt similar thingsThe tiniest things trigger me and I don’t know what to do. Constant mood swings are ruining my life Every tiny little thing upsets me and ruins my whole day/can span into the following days. For example, today at lunch I was waiting for my friends but after like 10min no one came. I texted our group chat to ask where everyone was (like 4 people) and no one answered. I stayed the whole time at lunch and no one came or answered. And I’m feeling horrible now. I genuinely want to just quit my job and drop out and stop talking to my friends. But I KNOW that I’m being irrational, I just can’t help it. I have been fighting back a panic attack since this all happened and I feel so stupid for it. But this shit happens all the time and I don’t know what wrong with me. I just wanna function as a normal personMood swings making me feel like I’m losing my mind. Why do I get such bad mood swings?? Just so often, I’m fine. And the slightest thing happens and I suddenly am suicidal again (like genuinely suicidal). But then I take a nap or take a walk then feel like “wow maybe the world is good and I should be happy” and it just continues on and on and on. What is wrong with me? I’m so tired of this. I’ll feel ok and then things crash down so so fast. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’m diagnosed with depression, anxiety (SAD and GAD), and OCD. Idk I just am feeling super hopeless tonight though. These constant mood swings are making me wonder if I’ll ever get better Sorry this post is rambley. I’m half asleep and very anxiousI need help with the basics!! How do I figure out my undertones?? And is there a way to still let my freckles show through? I have absolutely no experience with makeup, other than just using eyebrow gel. I wanna get into it though because it seems fun. But I don’t know where to start!! I don’t know how to find my undertones :•( which i assume is important for picking out foundation colors/ figuring out what eyeshadows and blushes will look good on you And I wanna be able to still see my freckles through the makeup, as I quite like them I love simple makeup, Korean makeup for example. I think it’s super beautiful. I would also love to try out some fun eyeshadow :•) If anyone has tips on where to begin, pls lemme know!! Thank uWondering if it’s not actually IBS-C? The meds haven’t worked. Any thoughts? I got put on a generic brand of linzess (sp?) for a week or so initially. Idk if it was very different from linzess, but it made me feel awful!! I just got really nauseous, and it didn’t help with going to the bathroom at all. (Also, I should mention the reason it was the generic brand is bc my insurance wouldn’t cover linzess) Then I got put on Motegrity, which I’m still on now (2mg). It gave me diarrhea for the first like 2-3days but then I just returned to being constipated. I’ve been on it a little over 2 months now Wondering if perhaps it isn’t IBS-C? I tried googling it but was kinda confused about what I was reading, so if anyone has thoughts on alternate issues I would appreciate it! I have testing coming up somewhat soon. One is an endoscopy type of thing where they’re gonna test my reflux levels (I have GERD) and the other (I forget the name) is one where they test the strength of my anal muscles or something. I practically begged them to do these tests, since I’ve never had any lower GI work done/ I haven’t had an upper endoscopy in almost 4 years and my problems are getting worse. Still waiting on my doctor to fill out the paperwork he was supposed to fill out a month ago (I call the office every week). But hopefully those tests will be scheduled soon But Yeah, if anyone has ideas as to what this could be/ ideas on tests I should ask for, pls lemme know. I can explain more abt my symptoms in the replies if needed tooHelp for trans young people (I’m newly 18) in MA? Especially housing Hey all, I think I may be found out soon… which will mean I may be kicked out soon. If I don’t get kicked out for this, then my dad will probably kick me out for something else bc he is a scumbag (he’s kicked me out before over nothing) Anyone know of any housing/any resources for trans youth/young adults in MA, specifically Boston or near Boston? I’m moving out in late august because I’ll be starting college, but I am afraid of losing housing before then Any resources, even ones not linked to housing, are appreciated!! Thank youIce pick headache causing wicked pain!!! Needing advice on what to do I get these multiple times a week. Usually will get like 1-10 stabbing pains in my head a day, usually on the back of the top of my head kinda near my ears? And usually the left side, though it switches Some nights I’ll get more of them though, which is happening tonight. Every 2-15min I get them. It makes me flinch and it really hurts. My neck feels sore as well. I have a hot pack on my neck rn and my room is dimly lit (though I don’t think light has much effect on my headaches so idk if this helps). Anyone have tips on what to do to get them to settle down ASAP? It’s been going on like this for like 2hrs nowAfraid to sleep. Anxiety and health issues getting worse and worse Hi all, To preface, I have IBS-C and GERD so I’m n* pretty much all the time But lately, my health issues have been so so bad. And I feel n* much more. Both more often and more intensely. The other week, I woke up at like 1am feeling incredibly n*. It was…. Very very intense and scary. And ever since then, I’ve barely been able to get to sleep at night, in fears that it’ll happen again. Please help. I keep missing school because of it. I wake up at 5:45 every morning, but lately I can’t get to bed until at least 1-2am. I’m so exhausted and anxious. And I know my anxiety is making the n* worse, and the n* is making the anxiety worse. It’s a cycle that seems like it’ll never end I just really cannot keep putting up with this. I feel I am at my breaking point, I’m so tired and feel terrible all the time. Please please give me advice if you have any. Or just words of encouragement. Idk. Anything is appreciatedDepo breakthrough bleeding and chest pain after over a year of being on it? Not sure if connected… but still stressed. Needing advice So I’ve been having chest pain for the past like 1-2months. Happens multiple times a day, everyday. My doctors said it’s likely related to my GERD, but now I’m not so sure. I’ve been on depo for over a year now. I was on it 3 years ago too, but had to stop because I was losing weight from my health issues, which caused months of bleeding. I never get any bleeding or any symptoms anymore. But last night I was supppper hot when trying to sleep (not fever, I just felt hot). And now today, I’m feeling hot, having chest pain, and I got my period. My next depo appointment is March 4th, which is still a good amount of time away. So I’m not sure why I am bleeding. Anyone know what to do? And could this be cause for concern? Other info: I’m on meds I take everyday, like omeprazole and cyproheptadine. But recently started taking Motegrity and Zoloft. I am also currentlu in a different state, and I had to fly here. Not sure if any of these factors could have an impact on my depo, but thought it may be worth mentioningHelp!!!!!! Have a cold and have been coughing and I’m feeling incredibly n*. I ate an actual meal for the first time in weeks tonight too which isn’t helping. Needing support badly I have a cold, and it’s making my throat feel tight. And my sinuses keep dripping down my throat too. And this all is making my GERD act up. Feeling super n* right now. The back of my throat feels cold from coughing, and everytime I burp I can taste what I ate for dinner I took 2 pepto and a zofran but I still feel incredibly unwell and panicked. Not to mention it’s almost midnight, and I always feel much worse the later it is. I am so freaked out rn. Please please help. What do I do?Covid again only 2.5 weeks after having iy? What do I do? Is it possible I have Covid again? I’m freaking out Idk what to do? I’m supposed to go to see my sister on Thursday (she got me a plane ticket for my birthday) and I’ve never been on a plane before so I was excited. I had Covid 2.5 weeks ago- basically no symptoms other than being tired. But I caught a cold from my brother and have felt unwell since yesterday. He was tested everyday last week bc his teacher had Covid, and he was negative. But the rapid tests aren’t always right.I have a cough and my face hurts. I want to get tested but Im pretty sure you’re not supposed to test again within 90 days in case of false positive. But what do I do?? What if when I had Covid previously I didn’t actually have it, and the test was wrong. And now I have Covid for real? Or what if I just caught it a second time? What do I do? I am so scared. I am not allowed to stay home from school anymore, and I am supposed to leave the state on ThursdayFriend got diagnosed recently, in the hospital for an emergency colonoscopy. Looking to get him some gifts, any ideas? Hey! I don’t know much about UC, though I have IBS-C and GERD so I have general knowledge of GI stuff. My (18) friend (17) got diagnosed with UC a few days ago after weeks of barely being able to eat, needing the bathroom constantly, and not being able to get out of bed. They have him on a medication he takes 3x a day and on an immunosuppressant. And they called him in yesterday to have him go in for an emergency colonoscopy, which will be Saturday . For now, he’s in the ER waiting. I’m visiting him on Friday, and wondering if anyone has ideas for gifts? I ordered him a hot water bottle, a water bottle to drink from, and some stickers for the water bottle. I read that it’s important for people with UC to stay hydrated, which is what the water bottle is for. And the hot water bottle is for cramping. Any other ideas? I was going to get him a UC cook book, but he has a hard time with reading, so I’m trying to find an audio book. Any suggestions are appreciated!!! Though if possible, please suggest inexpensive things. I’m not working right now because I’m busy with college aps/high school stuff, so I don’t have a whole lot of moneyI want to get into meditating but everytime I try, it gives me nightmares. Anyone know why? In the past I’ve tried to mediate. I find it calming and feel more connected to myself. But it always gives me nightmares! There was a period of a week or so where I meditated every night during my wind down routine, and I kept getting nightmares. I did it for a week straight to see if they would go away but they didn’t. And I’ve tried again on and off and it continues to happen. Anyone know why this is happening/what I can do? For reference, I usually will listen to a 10-20min guided mediationIs it weird to ask my GI doctor to do more tests? I still have problems with my IBS-C and GERD, and they’re getting worse, to the point where my meds/as needed meds don’t really work anymore. My doctor always just says to try a new med and switches what I take. Is it weird to ask flat out if they’ll just do some sort of testing again? I feel I may have a bowel obstruction or something in that vain. I’ve had an ultrasound once but it was about 3 years ago. And I’ve never been allergy tested or anything How can I bring up testing to my doctor without sounding rude/obsessive?Constant stomach gurgling? I got diagnosed with IBS-C about a year ago (though I’ve had symptoms for like 2-3yrs) and I also have GERD. Over the past month or so, I’ve noticed a constant gurgle in my stomach/intestines? It’s getting really irritating as it is almost constantly making noise. I also occasionally will feel it in my ribs/on my sides. Does anyone know what could be causing this/ways to get it to stop? It makes me uncomfortable. It’s not painful or anything I just really hate the sounds. Think it’s also important to mention that I started Motegrity for my IBS around the same time this started getting worse, so maybe that could be contributing?How do you use a “shower jelly” from Lush? I got one as a gift and it smells so so good but I don’t know how to use it? I thought at first maybe you use it like a bar of soap, since it’s a jello-like thing and it would make sense to use the whole thing. But it started falling apart so I put it back in the container. Then I tried breaking some pieces off and putting it on my exfoliater glove I use. I could get it to suds up but I was still left with pieces of the jelly that wouldn’t break up. Am I using it wrong?How do you bring personal medication onto flights? I’m flying for the first time ever somewhat soon and I’m terrified that something will go wrong. I know you can’t take drugs on the plane, but I have medications I take daily + I’m gonna be getting a medication for my severe anxiety over flying, which I’ll need to keep with me so I can take it on the plane/right before the plane. How does that work? Do I need to call the airport before hand or something? Or am I maybe just not allowed to have it. I know this sub is “no stupid questions” but this still feels like a dumb question to ask, so I apologize. I am just very very nervous about all thisLooking into getting tested for autism but now a friend of mine keeps saying I don’t need to get tested bc I am “definitely autistic”. It makes me feel weird. Thoughts? I’m looking into getting tested for autism, as I’ve done a lot of research on it and think it would be good to get tested. I think I match a lot of the traits, but don’t wanna label myself as autistic at this moment because I want to get tested. I have OCD and a big part of that for me is being obsessive over medical stuff- both physical and mental, so I don’t think I’m of the right mindset to label myself as having autism, since I could just be convincing myself of something that isn’t actually there. The problem is, is my very close friend now says stuff to me along the lines of “yeah you’re definitely autistic”. He is also ND, and I think he thinks he’s being supportive. I don’t feel comfortable with it though, because it feels like it’s validating my OCD thinking. The few times I’ve brought up getting tested, he’ll say that I am definitely autistic so a diagnosis “wont be hard to get”. Idk. It makes me really uncomfortable and idk how to address it :•\\ any advice is appreciated! And sorry if this is the wrong sub to be asking this onSmelling cigarettes and blood and I’m freaking out because I don’t know why I am smelling? Could it be hallucinations? I just woke up and started smelling cigarettes. And then I started smelling blood at some point. I do not smoke and I don’t have any sort of bloody nose at all. My dad and his girlfriend do smoke, but I think they’re asleep since it’s almost 2:30 in the morning. J am freaking out. I know sometimes smelling things could be signs of a stroke/ of a seizure. And I know sometimes you can have smell-hallucinations. I’m worried im hallucinating due to over sleeping? I have been asleep all day. Woke up at around 10 after sleeping for like 7-8hrs that night, ate breakfast, and went to take a nap bc I had a headache. Woke up around 2 and then ate a granola bar before falling back asleep. Woke up at 5pm ish before going to the grocery store to get some fruit before coming home, eating, and falling back asleep. Now it’s nearly 2:30 in the morning Also, as I was writing this, something else started. I can hear some what quiet metal clanging in my apartment.Like the sound of a fork tapping against a thin piece of metal. Please hell I am freaking out. I don’t know what to do(Writing this in speech to text, excuse the writing!) I’m losing my mind. Living at home is taking me to my breaking point and I’m so close to snapping I’m writing this with voice to text, so I hope this turns out OK. I just feel like I’m at a breaking point in my life. I’m so exhausted all the time, it just feels like it never ends. Living at home is actually just a living out of this point. Nothing I do ever feels like it’s enough. My dad always find something to marry me about, and nothing to do is ever actually enough. Even just last night, he came out the other day for absolutely no reason. I spent the entire day cleaning my room cleaning other parts of the house, even though I was supposed to be doing college applications that were due today. He didn’t allow me to do the college applications, instead making me keep on playing in the house cleaning my room and he had in the whole time. I miss the application deadline for two schools because he didn’t let me work on the applications. And I probably should’ve had the applications done sooner, but I genuinely haven’t had time. I don’t even have the time to breathe anymore at this point. I just feel like I’m losing my will to keep going. Continuing on about last night, I spent the entire day and night yelling at me. He kept telling me I’m worthless, saying I don’t do anything and I waste my life, complain about having to clean the cat litter, and said that I am ungrateful because he pays the rent and he pays for this and that and this and that, but yeah I’m grateful. But none of this is true. I’m constantly working or at school or doing some form of work in order to better myself. I leave the house at 5:30 AM, and I usually don’t get back until about six. Sometimes even later, like if I’m working I’m not home until about 10 PM. And this time is all spent doing schoolwork, doing college applications that he refuses to help me with, working, or if I am home taking care of my siblings. Additionally about the house thing and how he pays for everything, he really doesn’t. We live off government funding, and live in subsidize housing. So he doesn’t even actually pay for the things that we have for the most part. I sent this to him and he just yelled at me more. I’m just tired of feeling worthless. And I really just want this to stop. I just want to actually feel happy for the first time in years. And I don’t know how much longer I can live in this house, because I think it’s bringing me to the brink of breaking down. I’m losing hair, I can never sleep, I have no appetite, I’m always exhausted, and I have nowhere to keep going anymore. I just want to enjoy my life for once. I don’t wanna be told that I’m actually loved. And I don’t think I’ll ever get that here. And I think I need to go to this house, but I’m not financially stable enough right now to do that. I just started my job two weeks ago, and only repay I’m only getting my first paycheck this Friday, so I obviously cannot afford housing for myself. My 18th birthday next month, I’m going to apply for public housing, and apply for food stamps. I think I’m in the criteria‘s considering I only work 14 hours a week, and I’m in school, and I come from a low income household. I just really cannot keep going in this house.Paranoid that my father will kill me. Freaking out right now, please reply I get so scared that hell kill me whenever he’s mad at me. He was yelling at me earlier for not cleaning the cat litter/was saying I was wasting my life and that I’m lazy and stupid and whatnot. Then he yelled at his GF and they fought for a while. I’m so afraid he’ll snap and kill me if I go to sleep. He’s never hit me before, but I’m scared. He gets into this blind rage (similar to tonight but usually much worse) where he says the absolute most horrible things. He’s kicked me out before, told me I was the reason that he’s depressed, etc. And I’m kinda freaking the hell out because he could kill me tonight. I don’t know what to do. I have school tomorrow so I can’t stay awake all night, and I can’t lock or even shut my door because my cats need to come in and out (I’m also paranoid he’ll kill my cats). Please helpStruggling so so hard with mental health, largely due to emet. Constant severe anxiety, and my depression is worse than ever I don’t even know what to do anymore. I have GERD and IBS-C and both have been acting up like crazy over the past few months— but especially the past 2-3 weeks. I feel horrible. And tonight is extra bad. I ate a new food (pumpkin + parsnip soup) that I cooked myself. I thought it would be ok but it’s not. My stomach is making so much noise and I feel so so n*. And I am freaking the hell out. It’s so scary and I don’t know what to do. I’m so desperate for this to stop. It feels my emetophobia is getting worse and worse. I can’t even eat food that touches my hands, can’t touch my medication when I take it, am terrified of waking up at night, etc. I don’t know what to do and I feel hopeless. TW for suicide from here on I just wanna KMS. I just want to be done with this. My depression, OCD, anxiety and health problems are getting worse. Everyday is purely just stressful and I don’t know what I’m living for anymore. Please give me hope. Or tell me what to do. I’m so scaredI think I accidentally gave myself bad karma which in turn made my grandmothers dog pass away tonight So, a big thing with my OCD is that I get a lot of magical thinking. Things like “if I don’t do ____ then the train will crash while I’m going to school and I’ll be crippled forever” and such. My mentor and therapist recently have recommended I start having a morning/bedtime routine to help with how exhausted I am due to my depression/health problems. One of the things my mentor said was to not go to bed before 9pm. Because I was going to bed right after school (around 4-6pm) and still felt tired. She said going to bed and getting a regular amount of sleep every night could help me with my exhaustion. Well, today I got out of school early, and came home and slept for 4 hours as a reward. I then woke up and went to the grocery store, and while I was out my grandmother called and said her dog passed away. I was just with my grandmother today, and the dog was perfectly fine. And then tonight he suddenly just started dying, so she took him to get him put down so he wouldn’t have to suffer. He was an older dog— between 13-18 and he was a chihuahua. I can’t help but feel I caused this in some way. I wasn’t supposed to sleep. And I did. And her dog died while I was asleep. Not sure what to do. I feel so badMentor and therapist are suggesting I build a sleep and a morning routine to help with severe depression. Anyone have routines they like? Struggling really hard with depression right now, and my sleep is horrible. I’m tired no matter what. I slept for 16 hours in one go (waking up to use the bathroom only) a few weeks back and still felt I could go for a nap. My mentor and therapist both say I should create morning and bedtime routines to help my body and brain know when it’s time to be awake vs when it’s time to be asleep. I’ve tried to do this in the past, but motivation isn’t there for me. My depression has stripped me of any motivation or willpower and I’m having trouble figuring out where to start. Any tips/routines you all use?Pain/ache in lower right back/lower right side. Been going on for hours. Could it be from my IBS-C? Since about noon today (it’s about 9pm now) I’ve had an ache in my lower right back, and it seems to be getting worse. It’s not even severely painful— though it does feel more painful now than it did at noon. But it’s got me feeling extremely uneasy as I have severe anxiety over health stuff. I have IBS-C and I’m literally always constipated so I’m wondering if it could be that? But I’ve actually been able to go more this week than usual (I’ve gone 2x already!! Usually I only go 1-2x the whole week). I don’t see why I would be developing new pains now? I’ve been drinking more water too since I know it helps with constipation so could it maybe be that?? Idk ah I’m kind of freaking out. I took a nap to see if I could sleep it off but it won’t go away. If anyone knows what’s up please let me knowI feel like it keeps getting worse and never stops. And I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m ready to give up completely (For reference I’m 17, FTM, use he/him, and am diagnosed w depression, social + general anxiety, and OCD) For the past like… year and a half(?) I’ve been saying I’m going through a depressive episode, but can I really even call it an episode when it’s this constant? Nothing feels good anymore. It feels like everyone in my life hates me and only keeps me around out of pity. I feel I am worse than my peers at everything I do, and I don’t know why I even keep trying. Because I know I’ll fail everytime. I feel like I’ve tricked people into liking me. Because no one could like the actual me. I am annoying to be around because of how severe my anxiety is. It’s just been getting so much harder to cope with lately. I am genuinely considering dropping out, because going to school is draining and I am constantly having to leave class to take a break in the wellness office/ to go and cry in the bathroom so no one sees me. But I know dropping out would be dumb, since I’m a senior so I’m almost done with school. Therapy feels pointless because I’m too depressed and afraid to actually work on anything. Even though I WANT to work on certain things, I can’t. I am just too mentally tired. And I think going on meds could help, but my father won’t let me on anything. But I’ll be 18 at the end of December so maybe I can start then. I just don’t see a reason to keep holding out though. I have to wait til the end of December to even think about going on medication. And what if it doesn’t help? I’ve just stayed alive like 2 extra months for nothing. I really do just wish I was dead. Or wish I could just go into a coma for like a month or two. I don’t have the energy to kill myself though, funnily enough. I wish I did though. It’s constantly on my mind. And I have 2 failed attempts behind me, so who’s to say this time wouldn’t work? Sorry if this made no sense. I was gonna write more but I’m falling asleep. Please respond if you have advice on how to feel any better at all. ThanksPain in tops of feet, especially in the mornings, but sometimes later in the day too. Why? My feet have been hurting most mornings for a few months now. It’s just the tops of my feet, not the bottoms. It’s especially often in the morning, but my right foot has been hurting all day. Anyone know why? It’s not extreme pain… mainly just feels sore and tight, but it can get kinda bad in the morning, sort of feeling like using a muscle when it’s extremely sore from working out.

Was told by a doctor at some point that I apparently have flat feet, but it was never brought up again (not sure if this is helpful since this post is abt feet lol) • No substances of any kindGonna do it in a few months. I have it planned and there’s not much prep left I am gonna fucking do it finally once I’m 18, which is in December. I cannot do this anymore. But I wanna wait til I’m 18. Gonna get a job, and get all the presents I have planned for my friends for the winter holidays/ their birthdays/ graduation- since this is my last year of HS. I’ll wrap and label them, so they know what’s for who and when to open them. I might move out before I do it if I can, depending on how much money I’m able to save before I’m 18. I am so ready to finally be fucking done with this all. I would do it tonight if I could. But bc of my OCD I have to wait til I’m 18 (magic thinking is a bitch). Cant fucking wait. Everyday I wake up, and it’s no longer fun. Before I would have moments of bliss between the crippling anxiety- but it’s so constant now. It never fucking stops and I can’t get a chance to breathe. Cant wait to finally goI’m freaking out bc there’s a giant centipede somewhere in my room. So paranoid it’s gonna crawl on me while I sleep. Help ASAP I don’t know what to do. It’s at LEAST 2-3in and it was on the wall and it fell onto the floor. My room is messy bc I’ve been really struggling mentally lately, so it’s lost in my things. It’s midnight so I can’t go anywhere, and no one else is home so I can’t get help. I tried using a broom (the handle part) to Move my things around but I can’t find it. It was right across from my bed, which is right next to my door. I had to jump from my bed into the hallway (hurt my ankle sort of) and now I’m trapped outside of my room. All of my things are in there like my meds and charger (phones only at 6% now) and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been crying for an hour now bc I don’t know what to do. Called my grandmother and she said to sleep in my siblings room (since no one is home) but I’m paranoid that either that bug or something else will crawl on me when I sleep. I can’t sleep til I find it. What do I do please please helpMy best friend used to be mute before I met him. And now he’s messaged me that he thinks he feels the need to again. How can I support him? My friend was mute from age 11-14 and then when he entered high school he slowly changed and started talking. I only knew him since he’s been talking. But last night he messaged me about how he’s feeling like he needs to go mute again. He felt bad because he said that he feels like he’s choosing it even though HOH people have to be mute usually and how autistic people have bouts of/are non verbal. I tried to reassure him that he wasn’t being selfish for it, and that if he thought going mute again would help, then I fully support him. I just don’t know how to support him? I don’t really know much on the subject, so I thought I’d come here and ask you all what would be best? I know not to force him to talk/get mad when he doesn’t talk. I also offered to go out with him wherever he may be going (grocery store, laundromat, etc) so I can talk to people for him- but I don’t know if this came across as patronizing? He hasn’t read my message yet because he’s still sleeping. But yeah- any sorta advice on how I can best support him would be very appreciated <3Feeling super obsessive over hair-loss- but the people in my life say I’m not losing hair Not sure if this really fits but I just need to vent. And any advice/kind words are appreciated I feel like all my hair is falling out. It looks so thin in the front and everytime I comb through it with my fingers like 12 strands come out. It’s not like I have thick, long hair or anything. It’s short on top and shaved on the sides. And it’s thin-medium thickness. But now it’s looking more and more thin. I started taking b-12 vitamins to help but idk if it’s helping. I don’t know what to do, I don’t wanna be bald before I’m 20. Baldness runs in the family sorta. My dad and his brothers balded by 25, but my grandfathers and stuff had a lot of hair. I’m FTM so I’ll be starting hormones in like a year but dude all my hair is gonna fall out. I’ll need a transplant or something. But my family says they don’t see balding. I show them how thin it is and they say it looks normal. They make me feeling like I’m losing my mind sorta. Not sure what to do but I cry almost everything I wash my hair in the shower bc like 30 strands come out. It wasn’t like that before. My dad won’t let me go to the doctor for it (I’m 17) and he says I’m being stupid and stuff. When I’m 18 (December!) I’ll check in with my doctor about it, but until then I don’t know how to stop obsessing Help :•(Struggling a lot with internalized transphobia/ fears I’m not actually trans I’ve identified as ftm for almost 6 years now, but am still mostly closeted since I’m a minor (17) and live at home with my father who is transphobic. I go by my chosen name/pronouns with friends and at school but idk. Sometimes I wonder if maybe I’m not even trans? I feel more comfortable without a binder- not because I don’t like how binders look, but because I have reflux issues and the binder can trigger it. But I usually much prefer how I look binding. But sometimes I wonder if I’ve just tricked myself into mixing up dysphoria and just hating my body. I also feel gross for identifying as trans. Both of my close friends are trans (and they’re fully out) and I love them and could never be mad at them for how they identify.. but with me I feel horrible for it. I assume it’s part of growing up Catholic and in a transphobic household but even still, it makes me wonder if I’m actually trans. Thinking of myself in the future, I see myself marrying a guy and adopting a kid. I don’t know if I could imagine living as a woman in the future, but I can see myself as a man (though my gender expression leans more androgynous). Maybe being closeted for so long has warped my thinking which is causing my doubts? I don’t know. :•( if anyone has feedback or anything please let me know. Not quite sure what to do rnDoes my father have the right to take my things from me despite me buying them for myself/paying for them myself if I’m under 18? (Kinda urgent) My father is extremely emotionally abusive and an all around shitty person. He has threatened on multiple occasions to throw my cats out on the street and constantly berates me for things HE did. One example being how when my entire family I live with went on vacation without inviting me, my father left the house a mess. I cleaned it by myself and when he and my family got home he said to my siblings something along the lines of “I told you I left it clean”. I didn’t feel like arguing but was very irritated so I went to my friends for about 4 hours. I get back and the apartment is trashed. A bunch of food left out in the kitchen, trash on the floors, juice spilled, and stuff from their vacation was strewn about the house. The next day, he called me while he was at work and yelled at me and told me to clean it bc I apparently made the mess... The apartment is yet again destroyed and he’s now threatening to take my phone, iPad, and printer. I bought all of these myself/I pay for my phone bill. And I need the printer and iPad for work since I am a freelance artist and do commissions and sell prints. I don’t know what to do and I feel like I’m going insane because he’s constantly trying to convince me that IM the issue. Is he legally allowed to take my things? I’m 17 and I bought them all myself. But he says that since he’s my father he owns the rights to everything. Please helpI can’t do it anymore. I planned on waiting til my 18th birthday to do it but I might just kms tonigbt I’m so fuckinh stressed. And all my hair is falling out and I’m eating a lot bc of stress so I’m fuckinh gross and fat and ugly im so angry. My dad is a fuxking scumbag I hate him. Everytime he talks to mme it’s back handed or he’s screaming at me. Him and my entire family went on vacation without inviting me even though I’m 17 and live with them at home. I’ve cleaned tha apartment so many times and he and my siblings continue to trash it and get mad at me for it. And he left it a fuxking disaster when they went on vacation and I had to clean it and within 4 hrs of being back they destroyed it again. I’m so fuckinh tired I can’t do this shit anymore holy shit I think I’m gonna finally fucking kill myself because it seems when I’m hospitalized or open abt being sucidalnis the only time people care about me. I don’t know how but fucm I need to figure out a way I can’t do this shit anymkrwGetting overly sentimental/feeling so much love for friends that I get extremely sad..? Should I bring it up to my therapist? I just feel so so so much love for my friends sometimes that it’s hard to deal with? Like sometimes I’ll sit for an hour or two and have to journal about everything I like about my friends and write about everything that reminds me of them. And I have such an intense feeling of “I need them to know how much I care” that I worry I push too much mushy feelings onto them. Is this weird...? And do you think it has to do with my lack of self love/with the fact that I desperately wish for people to tell me they love me and to tell me that they care about me and to tell me about what they like about me? They sound like they’re linked imo but I’m not sure. It just is such an intense feeling sometimes. It even gets to the point where I get sad and upset because I feel like I can’t accurately portray how much I care about my friends. If anyone has any thoughts pls lemme know :•( EDIT: thought it would be good to mention I have diagnosed OCD, Social Anxiety, General Anxiety, and Depression. Not sure if this info helps but thought I’d mention it to be safe xHard stomach/lump in stomach? Likely due to constipation. Should I be worried? Some general info: I’m 17, biologically female, have diagnosed GERD and other digestive issues that I’ll be speaking with a doctor about soon. Main issue right now being severe constant constipation. My stomach is HARD! Not like hard when you get bloated, but it feels like I’m pressing down on something solid inside my stomach. It’s also pretty bad around my bellybutton- basically the whole rim (?) of my belly button feels rock solid. It feels like these hard parts can kinda move/shift? But I can’t tell. It’s all mostly where my stomach is rather than my intestines I think? (Other than the rim of my bellybutton) My dad said it’s muscle but I do not do any core exercise due to my chronic GI issues as it makes me feel too sick. Could this be a result of my constipation?? The constipation has been BAD the past 1-2 months now. I go maybe 1x a week, and 9/10 times it’s barely anything at all. It’s all pebbles. I’ve taken stool softener as suggested by my doctor and it hasn’t helped. Theres a few times where I’ve been in a LOT of pain. I get cramps right before my butthole that have sent me stumbling and having to sit because of how much they hurt. I also should mention I take omeprazole, 40mg 2x a day for gerd. And I take pepto bismol almost everyday since my doctors have been blowing me off and refusing to address my digestive issues. I know I am not meant to be taking it so much but I seriously do not have a choice at this point. It’s either I take it or I cannot sleep or eat. I’ve got an appointment (finally) with a GI specialist on Tuesday over zoom, but I just really wanted to see what you all thought/ how serious this may be/ if there’s any questions you all think I should bring up when speaking with the specialist?Am I able to call a hospital to ask if something is serious? Or will I be charged for their time? And will they even tell me? Just posted smthing on r/ askdocs so if you’re curious of my issue, you can read there. Basically, I’m having severe digestive issues rn and I’m fearing it may be something serious as I’ve not been able to regularly use the bathroom in 2 weeks. My dad says it’s nothing but said I can call my doctor tomorrow- but I don’t think I’ll be able to rest tonight without knowing if it’s serious or not. I’m in Massachusetts for those wondering- so does anyone know if I’m able to just call a hospital (like MassGeneral or smthing of the sort) and ask them if they think it’s serious? Or will they just tell me to come in? And can they charge me for calling?Severe severe constipation and a lump in my stomach??? Please let me know if this is urgent/what to do :•( I’ve got GI issues- the only one diagnosed is GERD but I’ll be seeing a GI doctor again in a few weeks. I’ve had digestive/bowel issues for a while, with me being generally constipated and only going 1-2x a week with little to no pain, or having to go a lot in one day. But the past 2 weeks or so I have been SEVERELY constipated. In pain when I try to go, and the most I’ve gotten out is a few pebbles after pushing and massaging my belly on the toilet for an hour. I get the feeling I need to go but I just can’t get anything out, and I’m worried if I push harder I’ll hurt myself. I’ve taken a stool softener every morning fot the past 3 days with my breakfast, and I’ve been drinking extra water and having juice here and there, but not much change. Tonight while in the shower, I was laying down bc my legs were sore since I just started volleyball practice today, and I was rubbing my stomach bc it is sore from needing the toilet so bad, and I noticed a lump on the left side, right where my stomach is (I believe). It seemed to move sort of? Like I could almost push it around with my fingers. I told my dad about it and had him feel my stomach, but he said it’s just muscle and that I’m a hypochondriac- but I’m still concerned. I don’t do any core work due to my GI stuff and I haven’t been working out consistently so idk how I would have gained stomach muscle. Should I seek out emergency attention? Or should I wait for the morning to call my doctor and try to come in? Even if the lump is nothing- the way I’m constipated is absolutely horrible and I’ve been feeling extra nauseous due to it. I feel like I’ve done everything I can- I take hot baths, drink stool softener, eat oatmeal for fiber, drink a lot of water/mint tea, exercise, massage my stomach, elevate my feet, etc. But I just can’t go. I’ve gained about 3lbs due to it (I’m normally 104lbs and I’m 107-nearly 108 at this point) I just like... I feel so badly like I have to go. And it seems to just be sitting right before my anus- but I cannot get it out. As gross as this is, sometimes I have to use my hand to push my anus back to get the stool out (if that makes sense??) almost like popping a black head? (Sorry that’s gross) Seriously though- is this urgent? AGE: 17 HEIGHT: 5ft WEIGHT: usually 104 but 107 rn GENDER / SEX: born female but identify as male (please use he/him) SMOKING?: no DRUGS/ALCOHOL?: no MEDICATION: omeprazole 40mg 2x a day, depo shots (birth control), and I take a lot of pepto bismol (I take it almost every day) for nausea and recently started on zofran for nausea too LOCATION: unsure if this means where I live or my area of issue- but I’m in Massachusetts and my issue is my stomach/ my bowelsIs the anesthetic the same when they take out your wisdom teeth vs for other general surgeries? I have to get my wisdom teeth out soon. Been avoiding it and hoping to wait til I’m 18 and my friend is 18 so he could take me to and from, but I really am unable to put it off any longer. I’m terrified I’m going to put myself as trans to the person taking me. I don’t really know what to do. I’ve been under once though for an endoscopy, and I remember when I woke up I had confused, and sent a “good morning” picture to my friends before being told not to go on my phone by the nurse, but then I was fine. I was able to walk with the person who took me out of the hospital without a wheelchair. I felt very confused but I was still perfectly in my right mind, it was just hard to process stuff for a little bit. Will I react similarly to whatever my dentist gives me (if I go fully under- which I likely will be)? Or will I have some crazy reaction like people in YouTube videos? I just don’t get why people always act like that after their wisdom teeth removal but then I don’t see videos of people acting like that after a different surgery. Is the anesthetic different?What do I wear to volleyball practice??? I don’t wanna wear the wrong thing :•/ I know this is “no stupid questions” but I feel like I’m asking a stupid question lol. I’m definitely overthinking this so I apologize. What do I wear to volleyball practice? This is my first volleyball (and first ever team sports) practice. The coach didn’t give any tells on what I should wear. I assume just athletic clothes? But should I wear shorts and a t-shirt? Or sweatpants? I don’t wanna come in being way underdressed (like actually underdressed- as in wearing way less clothes than everyone lol) ahhh :”•) And do I wear the clothes there? Or do I change into them? Again I wasn’t told but too afraid to ask bc I don’t wanna seem weird :•( If any of you have played on a causal school team for volleyball pls let me know what I should be wearing and stuff (Sorry again ah I have pretty bad social anxiety, and going into unfamiliar situations is hard for me)I’ll likely be gone this week. Chronic stomach problems have finally pushed me over the edge. Ready to be done. I have GERD and some other stomach stuff that my doctors don’t care enough to help me w. I’m on meds for the GERD but not for the stomach stuff- so I’m taking pepto multiple times a day. Ready to be done with this. Fuck it. Will spend a lot of this week chatting w friends so they know I care abt them. I’ll take good care of my cats this week too. Maybe I’ll get the new litter box for them I’ve been meaning to buy for a while. My family won’t care much. They’ll be sad, but after a little while me being gone will just open up an extra room in the apartment, which will be good. And my sister can come collect the cats and have them live with her Gotta figure out how I’m gonna go about this too. I should be gone by the weekendIs anyone else having issues with Crunchyroll tonight? New episode still hasn’t shown up for me EDIT: was going to delete this bc I have figured out where the screenshots are from! But I’m leaving this up in case other people have the same question 👍 Unsure if this is the right spot to be posting this- but the new ep is still not on my Crunchyroll despite it being out. I have a premium subscription so there’s no reason it should be late :•( anyone else having this problem? (Also lemme know if this isn’t the right spot for this- wasn’t sure where else to ask)Losing hope with my health issues. I’m not sure where to go from here bc they’re ruining my life. Advice needed I’m 17 and have had pretty bad GI/digestive issues for almost 3yrs now. It took a year for the doctors to finally figure out I have GERD and then they put me on meds. My health issues have been belittled and watered down by all my doctors. They say it’s all my anxiety. I’m so done. I’m still not feeling better and they won’t help me. It’s not all my anxiety. As someone who lives in my own body, I can tell the difference between my stomach acting up due to anxiety and it acting up bc it wants to. It feels different. I can barely eat. Barely sleep. Cant exercise. Cant go out much in fear of feeling sick. In the year it took for my doctors to tell me I had gerd, they spent most of it trying to convince me it’s anxiety. The only tests they’ve done were to have me stop eating dairy (I’m not lactose intolerant though my stomach is sensitive to it), an endoscopy to check for an ulcer, an ultrasound, and a stool sample to check for an ulcer. After that they sent me out saying it’s anxiety and GERD. But within that time, I think I’ve developed some sort of trauma in relation to my issues. Stomach has been acting up again for the past few weeks and I’m a mess. I’m so depressed and anxious- more than usual. The idea of having to live as I did before, on a diet essentially only consisting of saltines and bread and maybe fruit, scares the shit out of me. I had lost over 20lbs at this point all unintentionally. I’m at such a dead end and I’m kinda out of hope at this point. Doctors refuse to take me seriously. They know I still have problems. When they were meeting w me initially, they knew I had issues w my bowel movements. I go like 1x a week at most or I can’t stop and I’m in extreme pain. They know this, but never addressed it other than by giving me stool softener which doesn’t really help at all. Anyone else have a similar experience? I’m exhausted and I just wanna live a normal life. I’m so tired of having to cancel plans and not being able to exercise. I wanna be able to eat an actual meal for once. What do I do?? No one believes me. Please help Edit: some info on me that might help •17 •AFAB (I identify as male though please use he/him) •104-112lbs (it fluctuates. I’m 106 rn though) •I can’t workout much anymore bc my issues are bad again but I’m generally in shape •vegan but poor diet bc I can’t digest really anything, especially recently. Have lived off of dry cereal, crackers, and granola bars the past 2 weeks •on omeprazole for reflux. 40mg in morning and 40mg at night •generally healthy other than the GI/digestive stuff •from Massachusetts (unsure if this is important) •had an ulcer scare when problems first acted up. They said it was an “underlying ulcer” so not sure what that means • I take a lot of pepto bismol bc I have no other way of helping my stomach. If I don’t then I’ll be up all night feeling sick. I know the risk of taking it so much but there’s nothing else I can do •on daily vites and probioticsI plan on selling stickers and prints soon but need help finding a good, affordable printer. Any suggestions? As the title says, I’m looking for something affordable but good quality. I work very very part time- and I would only be selling about 20-50 stickers/ prints per update for now. Anyone know of any good printers? I’m so so bad with technology and stuff so I don’t know anything about what’s good or not :•( if possible I would want one under $300, the cheaper the better, but I would be willing to pay more than $300 if needed. Here’s some requirements: •can print from iPad (so like Bluetooth maybe?) •good color quality •has a scanner (if possible- wouldn’t need to be anything big!) •not super expensive And if you know of a better place to ask this let me know!Guys!!!!!! I am so so proud of myself!! After over a year of not taking my reflux meds due to OCD making me terrified of the meds, I finally did it!!! I’m on omeprazole (40mg in the morning and 40mg at night) because I have pretty bad GERD. It really messes my life up when it’s not under control. I can’t exercise and I can’t eat most food. For over a year I’ve been terrified of my meds because my OCD brain said that they’d make me sick (I’m extremely emetophobic) But tonight, I said fuck it and took them before I could think too much!! Still extremely anxious because I’ve gone directly against my magical thinking- but goddamn I’m so so proud of myself, dudes!!!! The thing that pushed me is how much I missed exercise. My reflux has been especially bad since October- and I’ve not been able to run at all or do much exercise since then. I miss it so much. I’m not even super fit- nor was I ever- but exercise makes me feel so good about myself. Plus- I might be joining the volleyball team through my school, and I cannot play if my reflux is as bad as it is now. So so proud rn :•]Took my medication after over a year of being afraid of it due to my OCD IM!!!!!!!!!!! SO PROUD OF MYSELF!!!!!!!!! I’ve been afraid to take my omeprazole (acid reflux meds) for over a year bc my ocd has convinced me it will make me sick. I understand logically that that is incorrect but gosh it’s hard to get over the mental road block. I FINALLY TOOK IT!!!!!!!! I just said fuck it and did it without letting myself think. I really need to be on it bc I have quite bad reflux problems that interfere w my life a lot. Super duper proud rn. Very anxious bc I just went directly against my OCD thoughts and stuff- but this is a step in the right direction :•D !!Looking to make art for each episode but I don’t remember what happened in all them :-/ anyone able to give summaries? Hey dudes!!! So I wanna make art for each episode of the cast as it comes out- but I’ve only started listening to it a week ago so I’m not caught up all the way (on ep 9) and since I’ve been listening back to back, I haven’t had time in between to do art. I wanna do a piece for each episode about something/multiple things talked abt in the episode- but I don’t really have the time to go back and listen to everything again just to do that. As the weeks go on, I’ll make the piece (or start it) on the day that the episode goes live, that way I’ll have the content fresh in my mind. But can anyone give descriptions of eps 1-8? Just the gist of what they chatted about/ anything important that happened (for example: when they named Mmhm or when they introduced Chloe etc etc) it would be really helpful! Thanks dudes xox :•] <3She never stops barking and I’m worried for her health. What do I do? We got a chihuahua pretty recently. She’s quite young- only a few months old. My dad and his girlfriend give her constant attention when they’re home. Always holding her or sitting with her. But now she can’t be left alone without barking non stop. The moment you leave the room- she barks. You leave for work? She barks. My dad left for work the other morning and she barked for 3hrs straight before I finally gave in and got her out of her cage (she can’t walk around freely out of fear she’ll eat something bad or my cats will attack her) She’s been barking all morning now as well. About 3-4hrs on and off. It seriously sounds like a strain on her throat. What do I do?? Do I take her out of the cage?? Or try to get her to learn not to bark for attention? Her bark sounds awful after a while so I’m afraid it’s hurting her to bark so much Any tips??? I don’t know what to do and my dad and his girlfriend refuse to stop coddling them dog when they’re home- which I think is making it worseFriend kicked from chat and we can’t add them back? I’m in a chat w a bunch of people and recently my friend Kat got kicked. They’re not sure why, and we can’t add them back. I thought maybe we had too many people so I tried adding my side acc and I was able to- which means it’s a problem with Kat specifically. Anyone know what’s up/how to fix this? I read they could have been blocked by someone but idk why that would have happened. We’re all good friends and the people who aren’t active don’t have a reason to block (obviously Kat could have been blocked but it seems unlikely) ThanksDoes anyone else get super paranoid that someone is stealing their personality and trying to one up them w their own life??? Or is this a weird trauma response?? Or am I just a bad person??? My friend- well call him James (not his real name) feels like he’s stealing my personality from me and idk if it’s from my OCD, trauma, or if I’m just an ass. I don’t know why I keep thinking this because I’m probably being stupid. He does this thing a lot where in our group chat I’ll say something and he’ll respond slightly or ignore me while other people respond to me. Then within a few hours he comes to the chat with a similar topic and gets more responses than I do. For example, tonight I had asked my chat what I should dye my hair. Sent some colors and my one friend said this grey color (which is what I’ll be going with!! Hehe) and James said it would look good. Another friend, well call him Peter (also not his real name!) says he’s also dying his hair soon and he’s doing periwinkle so he’s excite well kinda match. I’m perfectly fine with this because it feels like a response to me rather than talking over me. I left it kinda at that and thanked everyone for their input. James then comes into chat an hour later and says he’s split dying his hair (which I’ve also spoken abt doing many many times) and says he’s thinking grey and blonde. I’m so stressed. And I’m not opening the chat bc I don’t wanna get involved bc I feel talked over. I just like... am I being extremely petty?????? I grew up with my family ignoring my opinions on things/ they still do that so I think I’m sensitive to being talked over or whatever. But I’m paranoid he’s stealing my personality traits to make people like him and I feel so pushed off to the side. I don’t know what to do. He also will ignore me a lot and then switch the topic. Does anyone else here get that??? I am kinda freaked rn because I don’t know if I’m an awful person because I’m sure I’m being stupid but I can’t shake that he might be stealing my personality and I’m stressedCat now wakes me up around 3:30am for breakfast.... I am exhausted. Please help He’s done this the past 3 days now. For the past few weeks he’s woken me around 5-6:30. Our normal breakfast time is between 7-8 so idk what’s up. It’s really difficult for me though. I’m so dang tired. He comes in and breaks things til I feed him. But if i lock him out he scratches at my door for h o u r s. Locked him out today and he scratched for like 2hrs. I finally fell back asleep but woke to him scratching at 6ish. He’s 3 I think? Maybe 2. And I am so so fed up. I love him to death but I’m starting to really resent him over thisI’m exhausted and I’ve gotten to a point where I’m just allowing myself to be unloved I feel as if my personality is very average or below average. And physically I’m like a 2/10. I do not have really anything about me that’s loveable. My friends say they love me but it feels as though it’s out of obligation. I do not know really how to be a good person. I try so so hard but I don’t know.. I do not feel as if I am loved even through my efforts I feel as if there’s a wall between everyone and myself- so I can’t fully connect with anyone. I also feel gross. everything physical about me has a flaw or is gross. I try to use soap and deodorant but can’t shake feeling like I smell horrible. Maybe that’s from my dad telling me I smell bad though. When I was like 11 he would get mad at me for smelling like sweat but then no one got me deodorant. And I would smell like mildew and wet clothes because we lived in a homeless shelter for years and my parents would leave the laundry in the bathroom which would get wet and then smell awful. Maybe I’m still not over that or something. I fear everyone will leave me after highschool. I have 2 close friends who I want to stay- but they are closer with each other than they are with me. Both are able to give and receive physical touch and they’re able to be carefree with each other. Physical touch scares the shit out of me despite how much I crave it (refer back to hating every aspect of my physical self) and I can’t be fun and carefree because my social anxiety. I don’t know. I feel so lonely- physically and emotionally- that I’m just accepting the fact that this is how it is for meNeeding advice (kinda ASAP) on how to overcome medication fears One of my weird magic thoughts or whatever it’s called is that I have (for some reason) decided that basically all medications- especially my prescription ones- will make me v* (I can’t type the word tonight sorry) The meds I was on were omeprazole which is for my bad reflux problems and anti depressants/anti anxiety meds I haven’t taken either in over a year and it’s really messing me up. More so my omeprazole than the other one. I have really bad gerd and not being medicated for it makes me feel really sick and it makes my anxiety high bc I’m extremely emetophobic. Anyone have tips on overcoming this? I’m even afraid of holding my medication bottle or the pills. My doctor resent me a script to try and see if I could take it but I can’t. It’s been over a month since she gave me the new ones and I can’t. Please help. ThanksNeed toys for a super picky (kinda lazy) kitty. He’s gaining weight and I wanna make sure he stays healthy Cat info: •hes 6yrs old •not super playful. Likes to sleep at the end of my bed or in my socks lol •has gained a bit of weight over the past few months •eats 1/4 serving of weight loss food in the morning and night •eats crunchies throughout the day. The crunchies have to be out because one of my cats will only eat dry food and she doesn’t like to have meal time Alright, so my baby Elliot has put on some weight. I think it’s from eating dry food throughout the day- since I have to leave dry food out for my cat valley now since she can be quite particular with her eating, and she has decided she doesn’t wanna do meal times anymore He’s not very active because I have a hard time finding things he likes. The only things I know he likes are laser pointers, headphone wires, and yarn. He doesn’t like string toys on a stick or anything like mice or balls. He’s very picky with his toys lol. Any suggestions from fellow picky-cat owners?? Or just general advice to get him to move more? I don’t think the dry food in the day would be a problem if he was more active :-( Here’s a short list of toys I’ve tried to get him to like, just so you don’t accidentally suggest one of them: •string on a stick with the feathers at the end •ribbon on a stick •mice (both rattley ones and solid plush ones) •really anything plushy or jingley •those toys that move on their own. Like the circles with the holes that mice pop out of and such • springs (one of my cats LOVES springs though haha) •boxes/tunnels. He’s generally afraid of boxes due to trauma. Only box he ever goes in is my sock box- and it’s probably bc it smells like me •toys that make a lot of noise •balls We get a kitnip subscription box because my 2 other cats love toys and we give away the toys we don’t use. Elliot has never liked a single toy from the subscription box :-/I really just need some support right now. Feeling highly anxious and really depressed and hopeless. Anything helps Hey all. I’m just incredibly down today. Teeth are all feeling really sensitive and I’ve been thinking a lot about all of the awful things about my teeth (my oral health sucks) To add to that- I’m failing 4 classes and living in a depression nest. I’m just exhausted. I need the winter to end. I’m so anxious all the time and I can’t bring myself to do any school work or take care of myself at all. I just need some support (no private messages please) I have been on Reddit for abt an hour tonight and it’s made me extremely anxious too. Not sure why. Maybe it’s a combination of everything that’s happening rn. I’m tired as hell so may fall asleep before I can reply. But please leave supportTRIGGER WARNING FOR SELF HARM MENTION: Anyone else’s OCD keep them from self harming??? Again- TW for self harm talk. Nothing graphic but will be mentioning cutting. I am about a year clean and it’s solely due to my ocd. Just as background- I’m extremely emetophobic (fear of vomiting) and I had been self harming for about 3yrs very consistently. One night I felt super nauseous and (I’m not religious and am not sure what I believe. But I was raised catholic so sometimes I talk to god if he’s even there) I said to god that if I never self harmed again then I wasn’t allowed to be sick. I ended up being ok that night. And I haven’t self harmed since. It’s hard- because the desire has never gone away. I’m just waiting it out. The only 2 ways I could do it again is if I A) vomit and therefore do the consequence without having done the thing to cause it or B) turn 18 (I’m 17 atm) Idk I am just wondering if anyone else’s self harm habits have stopped due to their ocd???I’m sorry- I know I post here a lot. But I’m just feeling extremely insecure about my teeth and a bit hopeless. This is just a rant. Sorry if it doesn’t fit the sub- I can remove it if needed I just am so tired of the dentist. So tired of having to be numbed and drilled and trying out new products for my teeth. I’m only 17 but have had over 20 fillings at this point. I’ve had a root canal as well and I have another one scheduled as well as another 2 fillings to get done. I keep seeing small cavities though so I’ll eventually have to get those fixed I assume. I have minor gum recession and my gums detach slightly from my teeth in some places. Some of my bottom front teeth are also slightly mobile which isn’t good. I apparently grind my teeth and clench my jaw a lottttt so my enamel is horrible. Especially because I’ve got an overbite so my bottom teeth rub against the top ones all the time. I hate this so much. I wish I just didn’t need to have teeth. I’ve posted about this before- but I struggle to keep up with dental hygiene because of my mental health. And I’m just watching myself screw my teeth up. I keep floss next to my bed and do it every night now but that’s all I can manage most of the time. I know people (like my dad for example) who almost never brush their teeth and yet he’s only ever had 1 cavity- and it wasn’t even bad. Why are my teeth so horrible to deal with??????? Gosh I feel like the dentist always finds a new issue. Part of me wants to never go back to the dentist after my root canal so that I can avoid having to hear more new details about the awful state of my teeth. They’re miscolored from inconsistent brushing and from my enamel being awful. It really has me in a slump. Idk...having my teeth constantly hurting (my wisdom teeth are coming in) and having a billion problems that I don’t have the mental energy to deal with- and even when I do deal with them they don’t go away- is really awful. I know other people have it worse- but sometimes I just wanna get all my teeth removed and live with dentures because I’m so exhausted of having to deal with my awful teeth. Sorry again if this rant doesn’t fit here. I’ll remove if needed. Just feeling super down about all thisWisdom teeth removal has me terrified. Needing advice/ kind words (especially from those who have had their teeth removed) IM SO TERRIFIED OF BEING S*!!!! I think it’s the pain medication that causes it?? But I’m a huge wuss and I don’t have a high pain tolerance so I know I’ll have to take it :-((( I don’t have a date scheduled yet- but a few months back I had x rays done by my dentist and she said id need my wisdom teeth taken out. Unsure if it’s all of them? I know for a fact I need the bottom 2 out but idk if the top ones are in yet. I’m so so afraid. I’m so afraid of this making me v*. And one of my friends who has had hers removed said that eating only soft foods like ice cream and soup “fucked up her stomach” which scares the hell out of me. Have any of you had your teeth out?? Were you able to stay safe? How was the pain? Could you avoid the meds??? Please help :-( I definitely need them out soon because it’s causing pain in all of my teeth and my teeth have become even more sensitive. The backs of my gums hurt all the time :-(Paranoid that my dads girlfriend does stuff just to trigger or bother me I have anxiety, ocd, and depression. Idk if she knows about my ocd (though she has some misconceptions on it like that it’s only cleaning so maybe she thinks my symptoms are from my anxiety?) and I find she is constantly doing stuff that I have stated upsets me/stresses me out. She also is vomiting alllll the time bc of health issues but I have pretty severe emetophobia- and it’s a living hell. I’m gonna list some stuff she does/has done. I’m just feeling stressed rn sorry. •leaves microwave with time left on it instead of canceling the time •holds one of my cats that I’ve explicitly said doesn’t like to be held by other people (because he doesn’t) •feeds my cats constantly even though I asked her not to •calls for the cats in the same tone I use to call them for breakfast/dinner. She’ll just call them like that so they’ll come into the room but then they’ll pester me til I feed them treats •leaves food out that’s meant to be in the fridge/freezer •constant misgenders my friends •makes jokes about my sexuality •makes comments about me behind my back in front of my sister who then tells me •says stuff like “I didn’t think you’d like this” or “glad to have found something you actually like” which makes me anxious because I already have anxiety about being hard to work with •comments on my weight and asks if I’m eating even though I haven’t lost weight in months and my doctors helped me fix my diet •talks abt how my older sister never texts her back to me because I also never text back There’s more- but I need to get to sleep. Do you all think she’s actually doing all this to bother me and stress me out???? Or is she just annoying? She’s extremely manipulative and will constantly buy things for our family. And then when her and my dad break up (which they do constantly) she’ll demand them back. She once gave my sister a $200 check to help pay for one of her classes as a present and then months later asked my sister when she’d pay her back- even though the money was a present. :-/ sorry am feeling weird tonightI have 2 questions: how do I get my cat to stop scratching my door/breaking things and how do I get him to stop stealing wet food from my other cat? I’m starting to resent my cat and I feel bad for it These are just behavioral issues but it’s a struggle to deal with. One of my cats, his name is Roland, is super demanding and it’s very frustrating. Hell come into my room at around 5-6am some mornings (which is what happened today- lmao that’s why I’m up rn) and start knocking things over and breaking things so that I’ll wake up and feed him. This is annoying- and I tend to not feed my cats in the morning til around 7:30 because I don’t want them to get used to an earlier breakfast. Because of him breaking things- I’ll lock him out of my room by shutting the door. Hell scratch at the door and meow to be let in non stop til I feed him. He’s gone on longer than an hour before. Sometimes I’ll get up and feed him treats (I know this is bad because it enforces bad behavior) so that I can get some more sleep. He and one of my other cats will eat the treats happily but then he’ll come back to my room within a half hour and scratch again. What can I do to help this? I have another problem too. He’s super good driven. 2 of my cats- Roland (the one previously mentioned) and Elliot eat wet food in the morning and night and have crunchies out during the day. Roland is a pain to deal with though. I can’t put the food down for them and leave it- I have to watch them eat so I can stop Roland from taking elliots food. I have Roland half way across the kitchen to try and get him to not notice Elliot but he always ends up eating his food and then running to elliots bowl to steal what he can before I can stop him. It’s not like I don’t feed him- he’s not fat but he’s on the thick side. And idk what to do. If I could just leave the food out and go back to sleep then I wouldn’t have to worry so much about him waking me up to eat so early. Some info that could be helpful: •Roland is like 2 or 3? •Elliot (the cat he steals from) is about 6 •Roland eats out of a slow feeder bowl •he’s on a prescription food for his bladder problems (gets reoccurring UTIs •Elliot just eats regular food- which I think Roland loves •Elliot is picky so I don’t wanna change his food. But Roland eats anything •Roland will scratch at my door a lot throughout the day if it’s closed and he wants to come in. Even if it’s not feeding time. This gets in the way of my schedule and it’s annoying to deal with. I leave my door open a lot but sometimes I need some space to do what I’m doing and want it shut •I have tried feeding Roland in a separate room but came up with the same problem. If I left the door open he would eat and then run to Elliots food. If I closed it I would have to wait for Elliot to finish before opening it again- which is basically the same process as before Any advice for either issue would be great. It’s really getting out of hand and I’m starting to resent my cat. I get stressed every time he’s in my room- even if it’s just the middle of the day when no feeding needs to be done. I feel so bad for feeling this wayHope this is ok for me to be asking- but when posting selfie’s here can people please start adding their pronouns or how they identify?? I feel bad because I don’t comment on selfies half the time because I don’t wanna misgender someone. I find that these subs are primarily trans women and that it’s often assumed that people posting selfie’s are mtf. It’s fine that it’s mostly trans women- but I’ve seen trans men be misgendered which sucks :-// I will sometimes go through a persons post history to see if they are part of ftm, n-b, or mtf subs so I can comment on their selfie’s correctly- but often times I’ll just skip over their picture entirely. Hope this isn’t too annoying- it would just be really helpful to see people put their pronouns when posting selfies /genWhy do people rarely put their pronouns when talking about passing in trans subs?????? It’s irritating and I feel bad for saying that. But I notice that often times people will post into trans subs w photos of themselves and not out pronouns but ask if they pass but like...how am I meant to know what you’re meaning to pass as? Sometimes it’s obvious but sometimes it’s not. Not saying it’s bad for it to not be obvious. I have had people tell me (even though I put pronouns) that they thought I was male to female even though I’m female to male. I’m not an obvious person because I look pretty androgynous- which is fine. I think part of it is because trans subs- the general ones that aren’t geared toward ftm of mtf or n-b people, are primarily trans women and so they assume you’ll know what they identify as? Idk. It’s just difficult because I do not wanna be rude to someone when they ask if they pass but if they don’t give pronouns I might misgender them. Idk- does anyone else get bothered by this?Is it normal to feel jealous and upset over your friend being out/ having a supportive family/ being able to start hormones before you? My friend and I are both 17. And he had been out for like 5yrs now and he’s starting T in about a month. His whole family is hella accepting and stuff. I almost wanna tell him to not talk to me about his transition. I wanna tell him to not mention his T or to not mention that he’s having discussions about top surgery with his parents. That would be mean of me though, so I grin and bear it. I’m not out at home because a majority of my family isn’t accepting of trans stuff. I won’t be able to start t until I’ve moved out and even then it’ll take a while because I’ll have to see a gender therapist first. I can’t wear my binder at home and I’m constantly being misgendered and being called the wrong name since I can’t be out yet. I’m afraid to date (I’m gay) because I’m afraid that since I’m so early in my transition that no guy could ever like me. It just sucks seeing my friend move so far ahead of me. I feel so jealous and almost mad at him for having a good support system. Idk...I know I’m being childish but it bothers me to hear him talk about how he’s starting T soon and how his boyfriend is supportive and how his family is supportive. Sorry, idk if this is the right sub for this. But I needed to put this out there :•/Got out of bed today and have started doing school work! Last night I had a pretty bad panic attack because one of my magical thoughts came through (magical thinking is thinking your thoughts impact reality. I have OCD which is why I get them) Having one of them come true really sorta cemented in my mind that these thoughts are real and that they can have real consequences- which logically I get isn’t true but I can’t help but feel it. Was left feeling really depressed last night and into this morning. I finally got out of bed and actually participated in class (had gone to both of my morning classes but slept through them. Only joined for attendance). Super proud of myself for pushing through this :-) it’s really hard to work through one of my magical thoughts coming true- especially one like the one that came true last night. I’m taking it easy on myself but am also pushing myself enough so that I won’t slip too far back into a depressive episode. Still feeling off but I’m generally alright :-)Unsure if this is the right sub for this but I need advice on if I would actually get admitted into a psych ward or not I’m 17 and have been suicidal for years. Have been admitted 2x- 1 for an attempt and for self harm and another for suicidal ideation and self harm. I haven’t self harmed in over a year but it’s not bc I don’t want to- it’s because of my ocd. I have severe emetophobia and ocd, and one of the magical thoughts I’ve had is “if I self harm I will vomit” so I’m too afraid to self harm even though not a day goes by where I don’t want to. I want to get readmitted into a hospital as I don’t feel very safe but hugely because I’m extremely depressed and my ocd is ruining my life. I’m afraid though that if I go to the er and tell them what’s up that they won’t actually admit me and that I’ll be sent home. I don’t want them telling my father unless they have to (like if I’m being put into the inpatient ward) so I’m very hesitant to go. I’m afraid that covid restrictions might make them more selective. But I think it would be extremely helpful to be put back into the hospital. Would you all think I could get admitted??? Also- does anyone know what the rules for visitors and such is???? Sorry if this isn’t the right subWhat do I do at the gym/how to act/do people care that I am clearly a very small and not strong person? This is for me to have once covid has settled down. I won’t be going to the gym yet bc of the pandemic, so don’t worry. I have started working out at home over quarantine but would really like to start going to the gym once it’s safe to do so. I have really bad social anxiety and I’m afraid I’ll make a fool of myself. Even though I work out, I’m still quite small and thin and I’m afraid I’ll look quite scrawny and dumb. Will people at the gym care abt how I clearly don’t know what I’m doing? And I have reflux problems so I have to work out in very short intervals with breaks in between. Will this make me look stupid and out of shape???? And how do I go about using equipment?? Do I just go up to a machine and use it? Or do I have to ask to use a machine? And do you have any other things I should keep in mind while I’m there? Sorry I know this is like a million questions in one. I’m just afraid of looking like an idiot and embarrassing myselfNeeding advice. I can never focus and I don’t know what’s wrong w me but am too anxious to bring it up to my therapist in case I’m just overreacting I cannot focus anymore on really anything, but especially class work. I have D+’s and below in all of my academic classes because I just cannot do work. I’ll open assignments and even if I’m feeling motivated I can hardly ever do anything. It feels like my eyes don’t work and my brain can’t process anything. I don’t know what to do. I have to apply for colleges next year and I’ll never get in anywhere with my grades like this. I don’t even know why I can’t focus. I mentioned it briefly, in passing to my therapist and she said it was from my anxiety but I haven’t gone into detail for her. I hate this so much. I can focus on some stuff sometimes- sometimes I’ll get into the zone and I can do a whole assignment in one sitting. But that’s rare and my grades are paying the price for it. For reference I am diagnosed with social anxiety, general anxiety, depression, and OCD. I’m really upset rn and I don’t know what to do because I feel like no one believes me when I say I can’t focus. It’s not like there’s something specific distracting me, my brain just hates me. And I really wanna do work. I enjoy learning and for the most part I understand all the material. :-/ Any advice or ideas as to what’s up with me would be really helpful. Thanks EDIT: thought I’d mention that I suffer minority from derealization. It’s nothing crazy severe I don’t think, but my therapist said it’s on account of my anxiety/trauma. Not sure if this helpsI missed an assignment for class and am avoiding it. Can I get advice? For context: I’m failing 2 classes (English and AP Bio) and the class I’m avoiding is physics 2. I already have 5 absences and it’s a double block so skipping today means it’ll go up to 7. Class started like 10mins ago too. We’ve had a substitute most of the year but last week my real teacher came back from maternity leave. Excited to have her back and such. But she assigned something and I haven’t even started it. And I know she knows this because she looks at our work during class to see if we’re on track. I skipped her class yesterday and I plan on skipping both blocks today (were already like 10min into the first block). But I have her class again for a single block tomorrow and I’m feeling anxious as hell about all this. I know the solution is to either do my work so I can go to class or go to class empty handed but I can’t. I can’t focus at all on my assignments (I’ve been talking to my therapist a lot about it lately) and I’m terribly nervous to talk to her about my missing work and how I didn’t even start it yet even though we had class time for it. I dunno... could I get some support or advice on what to do? I love learning but school is so anxiety inducing for me. It really sucks. If anyone has tips on focusing that would help too. It’s not the kind of not being able to focus where I’m distracted, it’s like my eyes stop working and I cannot process anything I’m trying to read. Hope this is the right sub to be posting this. Thanks in advanceIs the anesthesia they give you when you get your wisdom teeth out the same as other surgeries? I have to get my wisdom teeth out in a few months and I’m terrified I’ll say something dumb/out myself (I’m trans and gay and in the closet). I’ve had 1 operation done, which was an endoscopy. I remember feeling confused when I woke up and texting my friends about something incoherent, but I was stable enough to walk out of the hospital without a wheel chair. Is the anesthesia that I got then likely the same I’ll be getting when I get my wisdom teeth out?? If so then I don’t feel so worried- but ahh I’m scared!! Videos of people after their wisdom teeth have been removed always show them being loopy and saying weird stuff. Feeling scared hehHow do you order a drink from somewhere like Dunkins or Starbucks w your own cup? I wanna start using my own travel cup to get my drinks in just as a small way to help reduce my waste. I don’t think we’re able to use them now because of covid, so this is more of a question for the future. I just am not sure of how to go about ordering and asking to use my own cup? I have quite bad social anxiety ahh so I’m afraid I’ll say something wrong. Not sure if Dunkins allows personal cups (when there’s not covid) though. Does anyone know if they do? Anyways, thank you in advance xxOn verge of panic attack just need replies or smthing no dms- post will be censored but might not make much sense Sorry I don’t know if this even fits here but I don’t know where else to turn w this I am on new birth control and it’s making me feel so horrid. And I have GI issues as is and I’m struggling so much rn. It’s past 6am and I’m still up even though I usually sleep at 12 and I’m having a hard time. I feel very n* and I’m triggered a little or a lot idk bc I have GI issues that stated a few years ago that ruined my life back then and caused me to lose 25lbs by accident and I couldn’t eat and I felt sick all the time and had to go to the doctors all’s the time and I had to try new meds And I’m off my omeprazole bc of my ocd being stupid and saying taking it was bad and the reason for that Is a big part of what’s triggering me so I won’t explain here And my dads Gf is here and she has lots of GU issses and she keeps going to the bathroom to v* and it’s not helping. I have headphones in and am doing my best to not panic but it is very hard I don’t wanna dm rn bc I can’t buy if you could reply or smthing and pop in and say hi and sag this won’t last I would be appreciative thank you sorry this makes no sense I feel bad but I can’t think right rn I’m tired and feel bad physically and mentallyI don’t feel so alone anymore I only just found this sub and wow... I finally don’t feel alone! I’ve known trich was a thing for a while- and I suspect I have it? Though maybe it’s mild for me or smthing since I never really pull hair from my head. As gross as it sounds, I only ever pull pubic, leg, and armpit hairs (occasionally I’ll fixate hard when doing general eyebrow grooming and I’ll pull too many but that’s not often). I have OCD as well- which I assume many of you have since this is a compulsive/ritualistic thing. However, I learned that eating the hair follicle is something other people do! It’s called Trichophagia apparently? I have felt like the grossest, worst person bc I eat the hair follicle. I’ll keep pulling hairs til I can get a good one and then I’ll press the follicle to my lips and then I’ll chew it. I don’t know why I do it, I just feel like I have to. I haven’t spoken to my therapist abt any form of hair pulling, as I’m a little afraid she’ll see it as self harm and report me, even though I never do it for pain. In fact, the reason I don’t pull from my head is BECAUSE it hurts. I would like to get help, but I don’t think I’m ready to tell anyone in my real life yet. I’m so glad to know that this community exists here. I’m trying my best to get better and pull less often. Hopefully things go well. Cheers!I’ve brushed AND flossed 2x a day for 3 days in a row now My dental hygiene/health aren’t great and never have been. I think part of its genetic?? But I’ve always gotten cavities very frequently. I think my dentist said I had abt 10 or more cavities a few months back? And I need a root canal for a filling that failed. I’ve been real bummed. And I struggle a lot w depression, anxiety, and ocd- which often make it really hard to take care of my teeth. But the past 3 days I’ve really been trying as hard as I can!!! I’ve brushed and flossed 2x a day and I’ve been using mouth wash at night :-D My resolution for the new year is to be more consistent and brush 1x a day at the very least and to use mouth wash every night, even if I can’t get myself to brush. Feeling hella proud tonight!!! And I’ll update in a few weeks if I’ve kept up w it :-DTrauma related to medication? I’m not quite sure if this is the right sub to be asking this on?? But it involves emetophobia and v* and chronic GI issues so idk. Lemme know if I shouldn’t post this here. I have GERD and very likely some other GI issue (though my doctors have never figured out exactly what it is) It started around 2yrs ago. I would wake up and feel n* every day and I would then feel n* at night. Eventually I started losing my appetite, as eating anything made me feel s*. I lost about 21lbs unintentionally (for ref- I am already quite small. 5ft and used to weight 115 before this all happened. I’m back up to 107 now :-D) During this time- it (for some reason) took about 10ish months for doctors to get me on meds/a dosage of meds that helped- and even so I still have issues now. I used to take pepto bismol every day- usually multiple times a day bc of how n* I was. It was horrible. I used the chewable ones so I could carry them around w me. My GI issues have since flared up again as I’ve gone off my meds. I now get extremely n* a lot (not as bad as it used to be) and it’s awful. I’m constantly extremely anxious because I’m terrified this will finally make me v*. Anyway, I tried to take pepto a few weeks back and it made me g* (not sure if I am meant to censor this word?) and it was awful! I managed to get it down, but not w/o g*ing. It helped w my stomach but still...it was awful. I then tried to take it 2 nights ago and I couldn’t get myself to chew it. My body just wouldn’t let me. Ended up eating 5 tums and it sorta helped but not really. I’m wondering if you all think I have some sorta trauma or whatever related to this medication since I had to take it all the time when I was essentially in a constant state of panic and stress? I wanna bring it up to my therapist but idk,,, makes me anxious. Curious if this has happened to you all as well?Can people tell me more about Hanukkah/ etiquette surrounding Jewish holidays? One main question is is it cool to wish someone a happy Hanukkah tomorrow? I googled it and it’s the first day. My closest friend is Jewish and I’m trying to be better abt understanding what he celebrates and such :-) I grew up going to catholic school, and then public school starting when I was in middle school. I’ve never had any education on holidays other than the Christian ones though. I feel very ignorant, but a lot of the stuff I’ve tried googling goes more over just the history, which isn’t really what I’m looking for :-( I just wanted to know if wishing him a happy Hanukkah tomorrow was appropriate? Or do you wait til the last day to do that? I would ask him but I don’t wanna seem stupid... And if anyone has anymore info on Jewish holidays/the etiquette surrounding them that would be super helpful!! I just wanna be more inclusive when talking to my friend. Everyone else in our group celebrates Christmas and idk...I just am trying to put in an effort to make him feel seen. Thanks in advance!!! <3A close friend of mine has been blocked and ghosted by his boyfriend a day before their 4 month anniversary. How do I help him? Me: 17 Friend:17 Friends boyfriend: newly 18 Him (we’ll call him Jake- not his real name) and his partner (well call him Adam- not his real name) are in a long distance relationship (we live in Massachusetts and his partner is from the UK). They haven’t spoken to each other since Thursday. Last thing that Adam said to him was that he would like to meet him one day. Now Jake is blocked by him on discord and Instagram and has no way of contacting Adam. Jake gave me his boyfriends Instagram and I was able to find it with no problem. I checked Adams following/followers and they were no longer mutuals. I feel really bad. I don’t know much of what to say in this situation. I haven’t been in a relationship in 4yrs, and even then I’ve never been in a serious one (I was like 13 lol). I’ve been giving whatever advice I can (mostly making sure Jake is taking care of himself. He has depression and I wanna make sure he is staying safe) but idk if I’m doing enough. I reached out to Adam on Instagram to see what’s up but haven’t heard anything yet. Additionally, Adam wasn’t feeling well last week. May be flu or covid. And so Jake is saying maybe something happened with his phone and he’s sick so he can’t fix it? But that seems kinda like denial. If anyone has advice on what I can do to help, please let me know. And if you have questions feel free to comment. I’ll respond to everything.It might happen and I’m panicking I’m freaking out rn. I feel incredibly n*. And I keep burping and my mouth is all spit. This is normal for me bc I have chronic GI issues but it’s extra bad tonight. I might actually v* I’m terrified please help. I’m so scared, man. Fuck. Idk what to do. My throat burns And my stomach feels off. All day I haven’t felt well- not really stomach wise but more like I’ve felt like I have a cold all day. I’m so scared. Shit. I’ve also had a little bit of d* that was extremely watery. Though I’m afraid to try to go again bc if I push then I’m scared I’ll v*. I’m so stressed though I feel like I could pass out. Holy shit TW SUICIDE don’t read any further if this is triggering for you I’m at a point where I’m tempted to just end it so I don’t v*. If I’m dead I can’t v*. I’m so scared. I’m suicidal anyway but like, this really tops it off. I am so tempted though idk how to actually do that. Fuck. I really would rather be dead than for it to happen/for me to feel like thisHuge TW for suicide. And also talking abt v* Anyone else extremely suicidal over their phobia? Mine has gotten so bad where I genuinely consider just ending everything so I don’t have to live in fear everyday. I feel really n* tonight- I made a post abt it previously. I am suicidal anyways, I struggle w pretty bad depression and such. But this makes it 100% worse. The autumn/winter time is so horrible for me. I am constantly in fear of v*ing. And I just genuinely wish I were dead bc I’m so anxious all the time. I just don’t wanna have to deal with the fear anymore. I can’t bring it up to my therapist, as I’m a bit nervous to get rehospitalized (I’ve been admitted 2x. 1 for being suicidal and 1 for actually attempting). I would love to go back to the hospital, but have anxiety over my dad knowing I’m like this again (I’m a minor. Almost 17) Sorry if this doesn’t make sense. I’m just feeling extremely panicked and I would so much rather be dead than deal with this. And I’ve been genuinely considering recently- which scares me. Though, a lot of the ways would possibly lead to me v*ing, and so I couldn’t do them. Sorry again if this doesn’t make sense. I’m just wondering if anyone else feels like this. Marked NSFW just to be safe, since I’m mentioning suicide.Kinda urgent. Am freaking out a bit. All I’ve eaten today was 2 vegan soy chicken pattie things ( I eat them often. It’s a safe food). A few hrs later I’m feeling really n*. I stood up earlier and something went into my mouth? It seemed to be stomach acid though when I spit it out. (I have chronic GI issues. Specifically, GERD and possible IBS) After that happened I started feeling really n*. Now I’m in bed, just sitting and using my phone. My head hurts and my stomach is uneasy and I feel n*. I have a lot of gas build up too. I don’t know if the n* came from the fear after the acid came up, or if I’m s*. I’m really freaked out rn. Unsure what to do. And feeling very overstimulated bc of this. Everything that I can see and hear around me is too much for me rn. I kinda and terrifiedNEED ADVICE ASAP- extremely sensitive teeth, to the point where I can barely eat/can’t brush some of my teeth! Was at the dentist yesterday, getting a filling. We had spoke about how I will need a mouth guard eventually because I apparently grind my teeth a lot/I’ll need braces to keep my teeth from grinding accidentally. At one point during the filling, which was in the back of my mouth, for some reason 3-4 of my bottom front teeth starting really really bothering me. Everytime she touched them accidentally I would jump away because it was such a shock. It was like my teeth were dipped into ice cream Now, I’m almost 100% sure it’s due to my worn down enamel on them, since she said a lot of my front teeth are worn down from how my teeth sit in my mouth, but I don’t get why they started hurting so horribly all of a sudden. She put some varnish on them, along with a few others that she felt would benefit from it, and finished my filling. They felt a little better for a while, still sensitive but ok. Until I got home. After a while from being home, I noticed they went right back to being unbelievably sensitive. I could barely eat because anytime anything even barely touched my teeth, I was in pain. I ended up skipping brushing my teeth because I though maybe I could sleep it off. But here I am, this morning, trying to brush and floss. I am able to sort of brush my other teeth, but I can’t floss bc my fingers/the floss bump the front teeth. I can’t even brush the front teeth a little. Please please help. I don’t know what to do. Why did they act up all of a sudden? My dentist thinks maybe I had some gunk on them that was protecting them and that it came off while she was working on my mouth, but idk. I texted her about it and she told me to take Advil, wait a while, then take Tylenol. And she said to use a certain mouthwash and to brush with sensidine (spelling?) toothpaste. I can’t even brush those teeth though. Sorry this is so long, I’m just overwhelmed because my bottom teeth (theres 3-4 of them that hurt, but one of them is really bad) are really painful and sensitive and I just really don’t know what to do. Does this constitute as an emergency? And should I go back to the dentist today??? Even when she was touching them and trying to look at them it hurt extremely bad. Even just the floss touching them- not going between them, just touching them, hurt. Please send adviceI get extremely paranoid about being killed. Especially when someone is mad at me I’m posting this to both mentalillness and ocd, so if you are in both subs and see this, that’s why. To start, I’m 16 and I have ocd, depression, mild ptsd, and both social anxiety and general anxiety. I don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. I have really severe paranoia that I’ll be murdered. I sleep with a knife in my room and check the doors all the time to be safe. The other day I was cat sitting at someone’s house (so I was alone) and the floors kept creaking and I full on sobbed bc I was terrified that I was about to be killed. I genuinely believed I was about to die. Along with this, I get afraid that someone will kill me or other people when they’re angry. So, for example, my younger siblings were arguing earlier (they’re 8 and 12) and I yelled at them and sent them to bed. I feel so freaked that one of them might just kill the other or that they’ll kill me because I yelled at them (I try not to yell as I don’t wanna be a part of their trauma/yelling is bad) Is this normal? I don’t know what to do. I wanna talk to my therapist about it but I don’t want to get anyone in my family in trouble. I feel this way with basically everyone when they’re angry at me, or if they have any sort of mental illness. I don’t really know what to do. I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for. I guess I just wanna know why this happens and if there’s something I can do to fix it? And is it ocd related?Extremely paranoid abt being killed?

And is it ocd related?When I get dysphoric I get self destructive I’m very tired rn so excuse any writing errors. I’ve posted here once previously, but to restate I’m 16, nearly 17, ftm, and am not out at home or at school (only out to friends). School started for me today and it made me realize how unhealthy my reactions to dysphoria are. Being deadnamed and misgendered all day was really difficult, so I decided tomorrow I’ll dress hyper feminine and such. As a way to sort or suppress it and pretend I’m not dysphoric. I’m wondering if you all experience this too? Sorry if this is something everyone does and I just don’t know, ah I feel weird asking my trans friends if they also do it face to face, so asking here where you all don’t know me is more comfortableIs it possible to just suppress it? I’m 16 (will be 17 in dec) and I just cannot deal with this anymore. I’ve known I’m trans, or at least been questioning my gender, for about 5-6yrs now. I’m out to friends and online but that’s it. I’m not comfortable coming out at home. I am just... so damn tired, man. I feel like shit about myself all the time. My dysphorias been especially bad the past few days (should mention I’m ftm and use he/him). Is there anyway to just not be trans? It sounds like a dumb question but seriously, can you just push it down til it goes away? If I just try to live as a girl will it fix it? If so, how do I go about doing that? ThanksDo anxiety/OCD meds help? I’ve been an emet since I was around 5-6 (I’m 16 now) and it’s honestly been living hell. Won’t get into why I am the way I am, but I always assumed a lot of it was just learned behavior. I do still think that that is in part true as I grew up with an emet mother and most of my siblings are also that way. However, recently I was diagnosed w moderate ocd. (I also have anxiety and depression) and I’m wondering if taking something to treat my ocd could help? I was on Prozac for depression and anxiety for a while but due to my ocd I’ve not been able to take my meds out of fear of v*ing. I wonder if any of you are on meds for anxiety/ocd that have helped your emet calm down a bit?Smelly foundation? Hi friends! I’m not big into makeup but I wanted to practice a bit recently so I went to cvs and bought some products. One of the products was the “Silk Foundation Elixir (01-fair)” by Physicians Formula. I bought it because I wanted something light coverage and vegan. I shook the bottle- as it says to do. When I opened it,,, it smelled AWFUL! Nasty!! A bit like paint and something sour?? It was brand new. It looks fine in the bottle though. I put it on- thinking maybe it just smells bad bc it’s all in a bottle. But I could smell it on my face. I kept catching whiffs of it and had to take it off. Is it expired?? Or is it just the oils and such in the product? If it’s not expired I want to continue using it as I don’t want the product to go to waste. But please let me know what you think!! I just left a comment on their website as well so hopefully I’ll hear back. Any feedback is helpful :,-)Weird side effects-most likely from stopping depo? I need advice :-( I was on depo for over a year before I had to switch. I really liked the birth control at first! My first 2 or 3 shots went quite well and I got little to no spotting each month. But it changed. First I started to get 2-3 day periods each month where it was an almost regular amount of bleeding. For the record, I’ve always used tampons. I’m 16 now and had been using tampons since I was 11. But when I put one in during one of these short periods it was awful! I used a light one and it felt like it was falling out? Or like it was pulling a bit? It’s hard to describe. And then I tried a regular one and it really hurt. It wasn’t just normal tampon discomfort that you get when you put it in wonky, it wouldn’t settle. Whenever I would stand it felt like it was pulling on the inside of my vag. Then, I got my period for 3 and a half weeks at one point. It was super light. But it lasted for 3 and a half goddamn weeks. I had a pad on (bc I still can’t use tampons) all day everyday. This lead to a pretty bad rash that reminded me of diaper rash that babies get. My labia was very swollen and toward the end of my period I had little cuts on it from chafing on my pad. I stayed on depo for one more shot and it happened again. I had a light period for 2 weeks. I called my doctor and told her I couldn’t do it anymore and so I switched to patches. I was on patches for a good 3 months I believe but ended up stopping because they just weren’t right for me. Nothing bad, just the adhesive made my skin a bit itchy where the patch was and I was getting severe cramps again. During all this, I started to notice some weird stuff. The day I would first start my period each month I noticed a very slight burning right around my vaginal opening. Nothing much and it was mostly drowned out by my cramps. I still couldn’t use tampons. Finally I’ve switched to birth control pills. They work pretty well. I’m regulated and my cramps, though they’re still there, aren’t as bad. And I’m not as heavy as I was before I started birth control. But I get really really severe burning pain on the day I start my period. It’s again right around my vaginal opening (usually more toward the top of it) and I can’t tell if there’s swelling. It almost feels raw? I also STILL can’t use tampons! Does anyone know what’s going on? I hate using pads. I want to switch to a cup since it’s a lot better for the environment/ because pads make me feel like I’m in a diaper but I’m worried about putting anything up there. Tampons really hurt. They kinda sting? And I don’t know if I’ve just dried out or something but I have a pretty good amount of blood coming out of me and get even light tampons hurt (for ref I used to use super or super plus ones) My vag almost feels....smaller? If that’s even possible. I’m so sick of the burning and the pain though! It’s been going on for months. I don’t know if this is all from the depo shots or if my body just doesn’t like birth control. Please help!! Edit: I also thought I should mention that when my opening is burning is mostly when I’m not bleeding yet/when I’m very lightly bleeding. I have brownish discharge for most of my first day. That leads into light bleeding then a normal period.Me [27F] and my selfish ex [30M], wants me back, am I doing the right thing? I and my ex broke up because he was not ready for marriage (with me), and I was clear about what I wanted. While we were together he wanted time to decide, I gave him as much time as I could. But I didn't want to invest further emotionally, so we had a talk and he promised he would give me a yes or no in 2 weeks time. But at the end of 2 weeks he still confused. I started feeling like he was just stringing me along. So I went no contact with him, but we agreed that if he ever changed his mind about marriage we will get back together again (if I was single.) Initially was devastated and really stressed out. After frequent nightmares and a micro melt down I decided to pick myself up again. I slowly started realizing how selfish he had been all along. Everything had been about him, and everything happened according to his convenience. So I made up my mind that I was done whether or not he came back. And I went on a few dates with other people, nothing exciting. 3 months later he called me saying he has decided that we should give it another shot and we can pick up from where we left, meaning - he still is not sure about marriage but we can see how it goes. But I am pretty sure I don't want him back even though I single. Now he is trying to convince me and asking me to reconsider my decision. It's like exact role reversal. But I don't want to get back together. And I don't think I am doing this to get back at him. I don't want to marry a person who is as selfish as him. Am I right about not giving him a chance? TLDR: Ex had broken up because he was not ready for marriage. No contact made me realize he was selfish all along. He wants me back now. Am right at not taking him back?Starry night ✦ . . ˚ . . . . * . . ✦ ˚ . ✦ ✦ ﾟ . . 🌎 , . ✦ . ✦ ˚ . ☄ . ✦ , . . ﾟ . ✦ , . . ☀️ . . . ✦ , , . . . ˚ . , . . ✦ ✦ . . ✦ . . . . . . . . ✦I'm extremely sad Today my house burnt down. I've lost everything. I'm homeless now for the time being. I feel so helpless. Me and my little siblings were the only people home at the time of the fire so I got them out safely and got my dogs out but everything I own besides my phone and my headphones which I had on me at the time is gone everything went so fast one second I was watching netflix the next my entire 1st floor was in flames. Sadly my chinchilla and my hamsters died I was Able to save my 3 dogs and my cat from the fire. I'm devastated I know the only stuff I really lost was my possessions but that's all I had the only things that brought me joy are gone and I'll probably never get new stuff. I'm an asshole me and my siblings went through this traumatic experience and all I can think of is my skateboard and my ps4. I'm going back tomorrow to find anything salvageable. I'm sorry for the long postmy house burnt down I lost everything. June 25th at about 7:05 pm my step dads room caught fire killing my 5 year old chinchilla and my 2 hamsters. My mom wasn't home it was just me and my 2 younger siblings and all my pets. I safely got my 2 siblings out and my 4 other pets that where able to be saved out the house fairly quick but my step dads room, my room, and my mom's room were completely destroyed. Everything that gives me joy is gone my ps4 my skateboards Everything that I hold close to my heart is gone. I know people will say \"it's just stuff\" but I can't get more stuff I live in a really bad area of Philadelphia Pennsylvania. We are a low income family that can't even afford renters insurance. This is a horrible thing to happen to my family I'm really sad.i hate my siblings I (16f) hate my siblings (8m,8f). My mom gave me 20 dollars for watching my siblings which she barely ever pays me for. I thought it would be a good idea to take my siblings to get food cause I was in a good mood. We go I spend every cent I had because fast food isn't cheap anymore lol. My siblings fight and argue the entire time we are eating and they start throwing food at each other from across the wendys even after I tell them both to stop numerous times. Then on the walk home they are running In the street with cars flying by us. So I just walk normal home cause I was trying to get to the ac. I end up getting home before my brother cause he's a slow walker and then he snitches saying I left him outside he was already on our block like 3 houses down and now I'm out all my money and my mom is mad at me when I didn't have to spend all my money on them. I didn't even get a thank you from my siblings for buying them good with MY money. I regret spending my money on them I can't wait till I can move out[TOMT] movie or show about a high school student I'm not sure if it was a movie or a TV show All I can really remember is this kid was on the dark web and he tried joining a group but he needed to prove himself so he made a fake website so he stole one of his classmates credit card info and after that he joins the group and starts selling things like laptops and phones for one of the people in the group sorry if this it too vague I have a shit memory please help me The way he stole one of his classmates credit card information is he made a fake website selling protein powder or somethingthe thin film between fiction and reality is scary I have a hard time telling the difference between fiction and reality. My friend sent me a video of a simulation of what it would be like if there where nuclear missiles going towards the United States and even though I know it's fake it still almost gave me a panic attack because this could happen one day and my city could be targeted and I'd be powerless to stop it. I'm still shaking and scared. Idk why my mind is like this. I hate this. I'm sorry I just need to let someone hear me for once.Day 11 Today I went skating again by the pier. The pain was moderate. I'm most likely gonna go skating again tomorrow. Probably Gonna hang with a few friends get some food or something. I'll keep u guys updated m throat looks to be healing but I think I still have a scab on the bottom right side of my throat. It's very scratchy and is kinda irritated but I should me better in a few days. This was a very long journey but I hope it was worth it. Breathing is easier then it used to be before my surgery I hope this was worth it in the end. A little advice for all the people who just had their surgery or will be having it soon is 1. Heating pad for ear pain 2. In my personal experience ice cold anything hurts but I am sensitive to cold inside my mouth so maybe it's just me 3. For the first 6 days try not to cough too hard 4. Get mouth and throat numbing spray 5. I've heard a humidifier helps I'm not fortunate enough to have one but I have an ac and I've used that to keep the air cold in my room and thst helps me 6. Multi vitamins/ensure because you cant eat the first few days. Vanilla bean ensures taste amazing 7. Netflix is really good for distracting yourself from pain so if you are binging a show before surgery you should pause it so after surgery you have something to watch lol 8. Keep a bucket near you at all times just incase even if you arent feeling sick vomit comes and so does the saliva floodgates you can't swallow so you will spit a shit ton hence bucket 9. STEER CLEAR ACIDIC/ SPICY FOODS. Listen to me when I say this Do. Not. Eat. Spicy. Or. Acidic. Foods. It's so painful the stinging in your throat when you swallow the acidic food no amount of water/ milk with help the stinging 10. It can be very easy the first few days to slack on taking your medication don't forget to take your meds make a timer every 3 or every 6 hours as a reminder to take your medicine . It is so important because if you don't wake up in the middle of the night to take your meds and drink water your throat will dry and it will be very very very painful. I hope this helps.Day 7 recovery Today is my 7th day of recovery I am successfully dealing with my pain I take 400 MG of ibuprofen and 1000 MG of Tylenol taken 1 hour apart every 6 hours. By hour 3 or 4 after i take my ibuprofen my ears start hurting but the heat pad I was recommended helps with that for the last few hours until I take it again. I lost like 20 pounds which I am happy for hoping to keep the weight off. I am able to eat slowly in the last 3 days I had 2 breakfast sandwiches and a few gummy bears and I probably should be drinking more water but besides that I'm doing well and I believe my scabs are starting to come off. I spit up a little peice and a bit of blood but I was told that is normal. I like posting these daily updates I'll probably keep doing it as long as I rememberDay 5 Update Finally got stronger meds Today is my (f16) 5th day of recovery. I have an extremely low pain tolerance. I get hurt very very easily and stay hurt for longer due partly due to my anemia. Following my last post my mom has been more sympathetic towards me and my younger sister who also had a tonsillectomy at the same time as me. The hospital I go to is a children's hospital and are limited to the type of pain medication they can provide so ive been taking 500 MG of Tylenol and 500mg of ibuprofen and I have to switch them every 3 hours but when I've been taking it I've been in extreme amounts of pain. But thos morning my mom went and got extra strength Tylenol and ibuprofen over the counter and I took them this morning and I feel amazing. The amount of pain I feel is limited too just when I swallow opposed to literally anything involving my mouth. She also bought me throat and mouth numbing cough drops and spray incase the pills didn't help.day 4 recovery TW: blood/details about me bleeding I (f16) just got my tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy on Friday April 29th and yesterday at around 10am I coughed kinda hard and my wounds opened up and I bled so much I had to get my throat recauterized and I stayed in the hospital for 24 hours for observation I got home earlier today at like 12 pm est and I keep coughing I'm really scared throat will open again it was one of the scariest moments in my life just having blood pouring out of my mouth and just throwing up and coughing up clots I hope everything goes smoothly from here on if anyone has advice on how to manage my anxiety a bit pls let me knowI just cried in the shower for 45 minutes I just got out of the shower after crying for 45 minutes because of how much of a disappointment I am to my mom. I'm a 16 year old junior in high school failing most of my classes and I'm a messy person. My mom is a narcissistic bipolar asshole. My mom comes home from working for doordash for a few hours and goes into the kitchen and smokes with my aunt. I come down a few hours later to look for a snack or something to drink and all she does while I'm down in the kitchen is belittle me and tell me how much of a piece of shit I am for failing and being depressed. So I go upstairs and get in the shower and just brush my hair and just cry thinking about how the only person's who's opinion about me I care about just hates me. This happened 20 minutes ago. She has no idea what it's like to live as me she doesn't even know who I am and I don't think she caresI'm not suicidal I just don't want to live anymore Idk if this is the right sub to post this on. I don't feel like I can go on anymore. I feel this way because of a mixture of my mental health and home life neither of which I can fix as of now maybe in a few years but I honestly don't see myself living that long. My immediate family I live with is very homophobic and transphobic which is hard for me because I'm Trans and pansexual. I know that if I were to come out to my family my life as I know it would be over. My mom would kick me out, I'd be homeless and I would have no where to go. None of my friends care about me. I'm single. My teachers and people I look up too definitely wouldn't help me. I just feel helpless like I'm Nothing. I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to post on let me know I'll take it downSaw someones face completely change before my eyes This happened in my last year of high school around 1 year ago. I was in IT class and when we walked out for recess I saw a group of other students around a table talking. I was surprised to see one of the guys that were sitting there as he had transferred schools but just figured he wanted to visit some friends or something. Then, suddenly, he transformed into someone else. I can't explain it, one moment he was there, then the next moment some completely other guy was sitting there. They didn't even look similar. The first guy was a big football player and the other was at least a head shorter, much slimmer, and had much rougher facial features. I was seriously weirded out the rest of the day and still wonder whenever I think back on that memory. Both people were not random as the football player went to my elementary and middle school and I remember getting a weird vibe from the other guy and saw him around school a lot. That makes me think that perhaps it was my mind playing tricks on me but that small guy always gave me the creeps. Has anyone else had similar experiences?\"Past memories\" are driving me insane I don't know if this is the right subreddit or not, please direct me to a more suited one if that is the case. I don't even know how to describe this. I keep getting these flashbacks from my childhood that feel so incredibly dreamy. They are so unnatural. Like a beach where the sun is too bright, hallways that are liminal, some ball pit somewhere. A lot of them have a liminal space feel to them. These memories are different from my normal ones from my childhood (even though I don't remember much from it). My brain is telling me I have to examine these memories to find some truth, like I once passed into a different dimension as a kid and I want back. I am struck with a overwhelming mystical feeling when I think of these memories, like a intense form of nostalgia. I so desperately want to visit the places from the memories but I am afraid they don't exist. It feels like I live in a dull alternate dimension and I belong in another place. I remember these memories started to appear perhaps 2 years ago. My other memories are also fuzzy, even high school which I just graduated feels like a dream and whenever I think back it's like a movie where I did not have control. Like I was a observer rather than an active participant. These memories are still different from the mystical ones though. Its like a itch on my soul, I feel like I truly do not belong in this world but I know that is foolish to believe. I feel like I'm truly losing my mind. I have no idea if this even made any sense, I just needed to tell someone. No one I have spoken to understand what I mean and even my friends have just started to dismiss what I say and just call me crazy.I fucked around and I found out Long story short I took around 5 g's of liberty caps thinking I was hot shit because of my previous trips. Time was nothing, I had my soul ripped out of me, and the gods threw it around in space to teach me a lesson. Jesus fuck that was insane. Really fucking bonded with my new roommate though. So yeah, obviously I was a fucking moron thinking I could just weather the storm like that. I don't expect any sympathy lol, this was all my fault. It did show me that I have some massive issues to deal with, probably gonna see a therapist, to be honest. All in all, I wouldn't say it was a bad trip, just extremely intenseParanoid about people adding me on snapchat I barely use the platform and I'm not a guy with many friends. I literally only use the platform for a single group chat and that's it. Just now 2 people I have never heard of added me. I'm friends with someone with an extremely wide social circle so I just assumed I got into some random peoples quick add. They added me by fucking search. How do they know about me? I'm worried someone made a dating profile with my snapchat name to harrass me. Considering deleting my account but my friends will eventually ask questionsSome questions before I try phenibut I have read up on the side effects and know the risks. I just want this to work for me. First, is tolerance to phenibut correlated to alcohol? I get drunk easily so will a small dose work or is it entirely different? Then it is taking it. From what i have gathered the best way is to take it on a empty stomach, flush it down with coffee and go for a run. Is this reccomended? Also I will go with capsules and do you just put it in your mouth and flush it down with water? Im planning on starting with 250 mg btwHow to change the surroundings in a lucid dream? So I've been on and off LD'ing for a while and recently got back into it with the whole quarantine thing. Thing is I have never been able to change my surroundings. I got my first LD in a long while last night and was surprisingly lucid. Remembering what you guys said made me stabilize it as well, thanks guys. Thing is I was in a town from the game Garrys mod for some reason. If you don't know Garrys mod is generally ugly and this was ***very*** ugly. I know it is possible to change my surroundings, but I want to know some techniques. Any help would be appreciatedPosts on the internet Hey, I’ve had a weird experience in the past where one day I was really bored and went on urban dictionary and I started to look up some guy name of some guy I had an argument with. I came across a post and then I looked at the profile and it was recently created and most of the posts were kind of related to our arguments and I got freaked out and some of it was mocking someone. I felt so bad like I kept analyzing it daily and I even texted him one time and he stopped talking because I think I upset him. I looked at the profile again and one of the posts were deleted. Now the profile has been deleted. It really affected my self confidence:(Random thoughts during audio Hey, I was listening to a meditation yesterday about getting a person to commit and I thought it might help to bring back a guy into my life. Next thing as I was listening some voice was like saying she wants to go on a date as if they were confused and then the next thing it said oh she’s just a plain Jane. I was really hurt by this as I don’t think this person thinks I’m that but I also have a lot of doubts about this person he negged me once and I’ve felt insecure around me in the past. So today I noted the time I heard the voice and I tried to listen to see if it would say the same thing because I already have a voice in my ear that whispers at the same time same things every day. I thought I heard the voice saying plain Jane before but not sure. So I tried to carefully listen and it didn’t say those things and now I’m even more disappointed because I feel like it was him that said it. I’m empathic and I feel emotions and then I’m always on the empaths thread or some psychic thread and people telling me it’s real and then my self esteem does a nose dive.I did a meditation and heard a voice Hey, I was listening to a meditation yesterday about getting a person to commit and I thought it might help to bring back a guy into my life.

It sounds real that you think it could be them. I’ve had a bad experience with this person. They used to compliment me or neg me. Yesterday I was watching some meditation to get a person to commit to you. I really need to stay away from these things. Next thing I hear is ‘she’s just a plain Jane’ I was a bit shocked. I don’t need to make my self esteem worse. It sounded so real and something he would say. It doesn’t help that I’m an empath and I get advice sometimes on the empaths thread telling me to use grounding or some technique to decipher if it real or not.I feel like my brain could be playing tricks. Hey, I’m empathic and I can feel emotions of people as if they are my own . Last year someone popped into my head at random times. Usually at night. I couldn’t see their face just their eyes but even their eyes weren’t clear but I could make out who it was. It’s like when I look around I’ll see these eyes in my minds eye it’s kind of difficult to describe. Then this year the same thing happened. The same person. I’m into law of assumption it’s kind of like law of attraction but not the same teachings. I would say these positive affirmations about someone and then they would just pop into my head even when I’m not thinking of them they would pop into my mind but it’s like I can just see their eyes but like I said it’s not clear. It’s kind of annoying because I’m stuck between thinking it could be my imagination or it’s actually them thinking about me.Splitting 50mg sertraline safe? Hey, I took a 50mg of sertraline for 1 day which is Zoloft but with a different brand name in my country. I stopped taking it after 1 day. I got suicidal thoughts and I felt like jumping out of my window. It was very scary. The thoughts faded but I had a slight urge to jump. I feel like the dose was too high. Unfortunately I was prescribed by a dr working for a mental health department in a hospital owned by the government. Their appointment waiting lists are long and I won’t be able to speak to this person until 4 weeks time. If asked his colleague for his contact details and she would not give them to me. I really want to take the meds for my anxiety. I know the side effects are bad and this is one reason I hate these meds but I know that I will be okay in the end and knowing that other people have experienced the same symptoms. I’m just wondering should I just split them or just wait till May to speak to the doctor?I don’t know what to believe anymore I don’t know what to think I’m just so fed up of feeling this way. I hardly never leave my house because I hate how I look. My family are always worried about me and I’m old enough to leave my home. I have body insecurities and I’m female but I feel like I look like a kid that never went past puberty. I had an awful psychosis last year where I did this stupid meditation thinking I could telepathy connect with someone and all I did was induce a voice in my head thinking it was the person I was connecting with. I thought I could hear their thoughts and all it was was this guy saying how I look like a bic pen and a stick and I need more muscle. I didn’t want to leave my house after that. Then this year for some reason I think I’m empathic and can feel when people are thinking about me. I also feel like I can sense people’s emotions from far away or even online. Which I believe is possible now the sad thing is I think that I can now hear their thoughts on what they think of me. This one guy on Reddit who thought I was cute we agreed to not talk anymore because I didn’t want to send nudes. Then when I’m on Reddit I’ll feel these emotions thinking it’s him and then I’ll hear these thoughts like I wish she was sexier or more sexy and then I’ll have some sort of mental breakdown where I won’t leave my house because I think every freaking guy thinks that. Then I’ll go on empath thread and think it’s them and I’ll get advice like it’s could be from them and I’ll just go over in my head if it’s them or not I don’t want to live like this and I don’t think I want to know what ppl think of me it would break my heart...Summer time & ssris Hey guys, I’m really pissed off right now. Where I live. It’s usually raining or cold. Today it’s warm and for a the next few days. I have social anxiety. I keep praying it rains. I hate these days more people out walking and lockdown. I just hate showing off my body and I think I’m too skinny and not feminine enough. I look like a teenager. I hate when people look at me when I’m wearing tight or lighter clothing. I tried to take a ssri the other day as I can’t continue to live like this. I used to love the summer but I’d avoid wearing shorts because my legs are skinny and I don’t want any attention. I took sertraline 50mg once and I had suicidal thoughts and stopped taking it. Now since last year I f***** dread summer time and I want to cover up. My mum is always asking me to go out for walks and she gets so upset when I don’t. I have to speak to my doctor to try and go on a lower dosage. I’m just wondering if anyone has any success with an ssri to try and get them out of the house despite your bdd?Getting someone to reconnect with you Hey hey, I’m trying to affirm that I’m in contact with someone here on Reddit and we are good friends. The other day this friend of mine asked me to remove them on discord because I didn’t agree with them on something. We first spoke on Reddit chat and I’m trying to get this person to get in contact with me and to reconnect and hopefully to be friends again because it was a silly argument. I’m kind of struggling with what kind of affirmations to use and also when I get negative thoughts that they still haven’t messaged me yet.Body insecurities Hey guys, I’m a 27female 5’3 and skinny petite person. I look around 16 or 17. When I was 16 I was flat chested and these 2 girls said I look like a man. Ever since then I had insecurities about my boobs. Then a few years ago I went up a bra size since I was a teenager. I’ve been body shamed a few times in the past and I had my ups and downs with liking my body. I never would call myself a man or consider I looked like one but I’ve always had a bit of low self esteem and I think that all these nasty comments on my body came out because I didn’t feel secure enough in my body. I always have guys into me but my fear is that if they saw me naked they might not like my body. I’ve had nudes leaked and body shamed over it. I go on body acceptance and small boobs problems to seek advice so I can start accepting myself and to talk to other girls about their experiences. Surprisingly some of the girls have had good experience with guys like their breasts. Then I’d get comments from people saying that there are guys that like my body type and I believe them sometimes but I’ll still have doubts. I guess I just don’t have enough experience with relationships to have a better idea of what guys think of my body. I keep seeing on these threads girls saying that men keep making comments or they will share mean posts from Reddit and then I’ll see positive stories from another thread. I know they do not have a good self concept of their bodies if they keep experiencing these bad things and I probably don’t either. What I’m trying to ask is if anyone successfully used to law to accept their body as it is and if people started to accept it too and the insults stopped??I forgot about my SP and a SP lookalike popped up Hey guys, Yesterday I made a post on a friendship thread because I had an argument with a friend and was looking for advice and someone messaged me to offer advice. As I was talking to them they reminded me of my SP with the way they spoke. They had the same name as my SP and they sent me a pic of themselves. I was shook. Had the same colour eyes and hair colour as my SP but their face wasn’t exactly the same. They were looking to make new friends and wanted to talk on other apps but I declined as I didn’t feel comfortable. I’m kind of pissed off this happened. It kind of makes me miss my SP more. I was actually trying to move on from the SP when this person popped up. I also realized something as well. I was so focused on the argument with my friend that I wasn’t thinking of the SP when this Reddit user contacted me. Although that day I did listen to a subliminal on YouTube only once to get an ideal person to add me on social media so maybe it was that, plus I kept affirming that I’m a master at manifesting and I did make an intention a few weeks ago that I wanted someone that looked my Sp but was a better version. So I’m not sure but I was kind of shook and happy, but now I want to move on but this person was so like him that I miss him now.Hallucinations caused by meditation or something else? Long post. Hey guys, This is my first time posting here. I’m not schizophrenic but I have social anxiety and struggle with negative thoughts. I don't know if I had some kind of psycosis last year I feel that some of you can relate to this especially in regards to hallucinations. I don't know if this is the right place to post. When I was 8 years old I started believing I could hear god and that I was going to hell because of some silly thing I did, I was on medication for about a year but the voices died away and it was only until last year that I started hearing voices again. I had an episode where I thought I could hear someone in my head and that they were in my body. It was very scary I couldn't sleep for days. I did this energy work where I sent energy to this guy. It's called remote seduction it's where you try to influence someone. I know it doesn't sound right but people believe this works. I was on a forum where people had all these great results. People were saying that you will feel their emotions and them thinking about you. You had to be in a meditative alpha state but then some people said you don't have to. I didn't go into the alpha state. I did it for 2 weeks and every time I did strange things started happening. My mouth would start moving. words would come into my mouth. I would start getting facial ticks on my face and twitches. Then my eyes would start to wink sometimes is every time the voice would talk. The scary thing is that this voice would say slang and words from the guys country and that why I believed it was him and then also I would hear him talking to other people and their voices sounded so realistic. I would get aroused and feel as if he was kissing me and you know the rest. Every time I did the meditation I would visualize him looking at me through his eye and that is why I felt like he was in my body because I thought I tapped into his subconscious mind. During the meditation I would get him to say how he finds me beautiful and that he likes my body. The reason why I did this meditation was because I was desperate and wanted him to contact me again and to fall in love with me and he only wanted to hook up with me and I felt like I deserved a relationship. It was not coming from a good place, I guess I wanted him to accept me and love me the way I'am. He always used to neg me and I felt he was a bit judgemental. I felt insecure around him and I thought he saw me as not good enough because I look skinny and short and like a child body so I always wondered did he really find me attractive or was he only going for me because of my race. I've only seen this person 4 times. I spoke to him 3 times in person. Mostly by texting. I remember one day I saw him at the bus stop and for some time I didn't recognize him. He was giving me a dirty look we were not talking at the time. He gave my legs a dirty look. I had skinny legs and the upper half I was wearing this big ass jumper and I felt so bad and I always believed he didnt like my body. I always thought he was out of my league. He had some muscles and was blonde blue eyes and tall. When I looked at his ex she was pretty and slim and his sis was very skinny. So then this voice started calling me names like a stick, bic pen, looks like a weakling, needs more muscle, just really nasty things. Saying that I'm ugly and that no one liked me and just calling me stupid and naive. This really did a number on my self esteem I hardly went anywhere. I stopped eating. I would just vomit. Then I actually made a fool of myself and contacted the guy accusing him of saying I'm gay and that I like to give bjs and he said he never said those things and he doesnt think im any of those things. I had to contact my doctor and then I had to be referred to a specialist. At the time I was trying to tell myself its all in my head and now I've realised it is but I still wonder if that guy really thought those mean things about me. I think the worst thing was this voice insulting you and bodyshaming you and to this day Im still trying to get over it.Thinking people see me in a certain way Hey guys, I'm sure a lot of you can relate to this problem. Where you assume people see you in a certain way. Last year my anxiety was really shitty. I hardly left the house. I had some issues with my insecurities like how I look and my clothes. I kept thinking people saw me like a child. That I look like a man and that I look prepubescent because I was body shamed in the past. I'm skinny and have small boobs and ass and really short with stick legs. So you can imagine how insecure I feel. Most of the body shaming was by men, so if I get a job or meet new people or go outside I assume they see me in that way. I used to be insecure about my body but I never saw myself this way until this shit happened. I was bullied in the past and called a man probably because I have a hooked nose and large head as well. I've never had problems making friends or having some guys like me. Then about 4 weeks ago I lost my job due to my anxiety. I was working from home and everything was done by messaging and hangout meetings. Thankfully I didn't have to go on webcam that much and many people felt very uncomfortable as well going on webcam. The worst part was the group chat for work. It really triggered my anxiety. I remember I joined this new group chat and the manager introduced me and no one said hello or welcome. I was really upset. I tried not to say anything on it unless I had too. I also had to introduce myself on a call and it was so awkward. Every time I said something in the chat I would over analyse everything. I would see who was nicer to who and who didn't text that much. I had to keep telling myself that I was over reacting and that I never met these people so how can I know if they like me or not. Then I was moved to another group and a few people were kind enough to welcome me and another person so I guess it depends if people want to talk or not as we were all working. Then I was moved back to the old group and I realized that people respond positively to loud confident people who speak the same language or maybe they are just confident. i guess it my attitude who knows. I feel that they did not like me and that I was just stupid to think that they would. I guess I thought these people would find me interesting as we were all from different countries. How do get over this feeling? assuming people don't like me just because they didn't respond or assuming they think I look like kid even though they might not.I don't know if this is a result of revision or not? Hey guys, I did revision 2 weeks ago and I affirmed for 5 days through out the day. I affirmed for my SP to apologize and to tell me the truth about why he treated me badly. So I affirmed 'in 2020 he apologized and told me the truth'. I did not say his name as I assumed it didn't matter and someone on this thread said that it was fine not to say the persons name. 2 days ago my friend texted me to let me know that she decided to contact a guy that we used to be friends with to ask him why he insulted me at a party last year. He asked her to let me know that he is sorry and was drunk and talking shit. I found this very out of character of my friend. She reassured me that she was trying to help me and felt sorry for me because I was very upset when I told her about this person. My SP hasn't reached out. Only this other person apologized. The thing is the last time I spoke to my SP I told him that he wouldn't hear from me ever again. I also revised those 5 days for something else but I haven't heard anything from that person yet. Has anyone else experienced this as well? Where someone else pops up in relation to your revision ..Worried that I might be developing BDD Last year was awful with the lockdown. I started picking myself apart. Constantly worrying about what people thought of my body. Everyday was a battle. I would be in tears trying to pick out what I was going to wear and just not wanting people looking at me. Last year I was obsessed with my legs and hips and how I look so skinny and not feminine. Now today I’ve started obsessing over something else. My forehead. I was thinking about the past and I was thinking about a time I was in a bar and I was with my friends and our table was facing a big screen on the wall and I had my back turned. I have social anxiety so I was a bit uncomfortable and I turned around to see how many people were in the room. After sometime some guy was talking and he said ‘she looks masculine’ and I automatically thought he was referring to me. I was a little hurt but I forgot about it. Now I don’t know who he was referring to because my friend kind of has an athletic body type and does not come across as overly feminine. I’ve been body shamed in the past and I’ve been called a man. My forehead sticks out but that is a genetic trait that runs in my family. I have a head that is big from the back and sides and hooked nose. I really don’t want to obsess over this 🙁My antivirus is notifying me about blocking multiple url fishing attempts from Google Chrome on my laptop. How do I prevent this in the near future? This alert often pops up whenever I open up another website tab or sometimes whenever I type. The alert on my antivirus will randomly appear telling me they've blocked the Url from something called datacloudstat.com which is a site I've never used. Sometimes, it's a different link but the story is the same. In some cases, this can try to open up another tab but will never fully load the page. As far as I'm aware, I haven't visited any sketchy websites that could've triggered this and have performed multiple virus scans that have all come back clean. Should I see my Google account is hacked or something? Should I uninstall the chrome application? I have extensions on my chrome account, should I try removing them?Is YouTube removing my likes from videos? Upon rewatching multiple videos, I’ve began noticing that some of them are missing my highlighted thumbs up on the radio bar even know I distinctly remember liking them. At first, I thought maybe it was just an misremembering error on my part and I hadn’t actually clicked the like button in some cases like I thought I had. But the more videos I experienced this with, it began to feel more like a pattern. Is this a glitch? Is anyone else experiencing this problem?[TOMT] [Youtube Video] AMV type video set to Walk Of Life by Dire Straits, featuring characters from Thomas The Tank Engine & Pixar’s Cars? The video was not an animation, I definitely remember it used clips from the shows and movies. The setting was all these characters were having a race and the video ended with different characters from each series decorated in the Dineco (from Cars) colours and logo as winners, I think Henry from TTTE and Lighting McQueen were featured in this shot. The entire thing was set to the song [Walk Of Life by Dire Straits](https://youtu.be/kd9TlGDZGkI) Thomas The Tank Engine and Pixar Cars were most prominently used and there was definitely footage some other similar shows and movies used in this montage but I can’t really remember specifically which ones, I think maybe Tugs or Brum were included. I saw this when I was young so the video is most likely quite old, probably before 2012, though the original might’ve been deleted due to copyright. Does this ring a bell with anyone else?[TOMT] [YouTube video] live-action short sketch about taking pills or candy that give you the powers of different Marvel characters I remember this video starred two women who discovered the bag of pills (might be jelly beans) and driving down the road testing them out, such as using the iron man flavour to blow something up and the Hulk flavour to break a sink? One of the women eventually throws up after taking an Aquaman flavoured one, with the other commenting how that’s a DC hero and shouldn’t be there. Police sirens go off as the women jump back in the car and take multiple pills for various effects, where the sketch kinda ends with them crashing the car after one of the women takes a Daredevil pill and is blinded. There’s a post credit scene where a male doctor I think discovered the bag, takes all the pills and we see his shadow transform into some kind of monster. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I’d assume the video was probably made around 2012/13, about the time of the first Avengers release.Missing messages and inconsistent comment disappearances Two issues I’ve been experiencing with the platform for quite a while. Firstly, all my messages have been completely wiped and I can’t find them on both the app or the website. I can’t seem to start a new message either as it won’t let me search up any usernames. My other problem is with comments. As far as I’m aware, most Tumblr posts nowadays don’t give you the option to post a comment. They also don’t have an option in settings to even view or delete any old comments you may have made. But what’s strange is that my old comments show up under the post notes on desktop but not on mobile? At first, I thought they’d somehow been automatically deleted but then found out they’re only hidden in the app for some reason. Does anyone have a solution for either of these? I’ve reached out official Tumblr pages on other sites but haven’t really received any answers yet.Did smosh ever do a remake of their old Spider-Man short video? I was rewatching the Smosh Is Board series of Ian & Anthony watching their old videos, which included their old Spiderman Spiderman video. I thought I remembered them doing a remake of that video years later, maybe for their 10 year anniversary or something, but I searched for it on YouTube & Google but could only find the original. Did I imagine this short remake or was it just deleted? [Update: found the remake in this montage](https://youtu.be/m5ixFEVnpvQ)To those already have some level of non-romantic closeness with their LO That jealousy you feel when they consider others romantically and you can't do anything about it amirite? At least if they were your actual romantic partner (ignoring possibility of lack of faith and general relationship instability) there's obviously some level of security and you know at least rationally you won't lose them due to them finding interest in someone else. But when they're not quite there yet as your love, you feel so stressed and tense they'll drop you. They've \"dropped\" me twice- once for someone else and that stung and now I'm paranoid and am seeing signs they're moving onto someone else again and I'm doing what I can to \"hold my ground\" and work my way to confessing or something. This is not good but it's happening ahhhI feel like I've left too many things public, and now people will connect the dots. I'm scared people will connect these dumb embarrassing things to me. It's so dumb but I'm near panic mode, this is ridiculous and I'm angry at myself for not being in more control. I'm prepared with explanations but no one is asking about it so I'm scared of oversharing by blurting it out and the suspense of being asked is eating at me. God the shame and the fear, it hurts- I'm gonna wait it out but I'm gonna be very much anxious in the meantime.Earphones recommendations? I'm new to this subreddit and earphones, my apologies if I'm doing something wrong. I usually wear apple earphones but they are a tad too fragile. I can't work with those silicon earphones or any others besides my apple ones (so far) because they don't fit my ears correctly. Due to the shape of my ears, the audio from both ears can be different if the device isn't big enough. I think a pair that fits near the outside of the ear instead of deeper inside like the silicon ones would also work. Sound quality doesn't really matter too much to me just as long as it isn't like, dollar-store quality. Are there any earphones about the size of the apple ones that don't have a rubber/silicon tip?I'm always the one to initiate conversations I've seen the way they text with other people, friends. I don't snoop through phones but I've caught a glance of my friend's conversation with them and it looked like a casual conversation. I didn't see the details or anything but when compared to mine, it's nothing but me talking to a wall, in that they don't reply to me and just leave me on read. With my friend, the conversation actually looks to go back and forth. I don't understand, we used to text a lot and now I don't send a lot or anything heavy handed... it really hurts and makes me really anxious. So the time span between my texts to them have been getting longer from a few days to weeks, because I can't stand the hurt. But a part of me just hopes for them to reach out and initiate a conversation. Or ask to go somewhere and hangout. Or even feel sad and miss me knowing I no longer speak to them as often over text. But they'll never do that and they don't give a damn I've stopped texting. Happy Saturday y'all.Need help finding an AUO B156HW01 V.7 or V.4 I've got a Dell Precision M4700 that I'm hoping to upgrade with an aftermarket panel. By many accounts, AU Optronics has made some of the finest TN panels before IPS panels became very common. Namely, those would be the B156HW01 V.7 for glossy panels and the B156HW01 V.4 for matte panels. I've been trying to get my hands on a V.7 (though I'd happily settle on a V.4 if that proves impossible), but it's beginning to look like the bulk of LCD sellers on eBay and Amazon are sleazebags looking to pass off a cheap substitute. They weasel in a little note that you're buying a \"compatible\" panel, when their descriptions often describe a genuine panel of that model number. I've been burned a couple of times, having had to waste time going through the arbitration process and lose money on shipping. Making matters worse, those panels don't seem to be manufactured anymore, so supplies are likely scarce. I was wondering if anyone might be able to point me in the right direction, so I could buy the real thing. I'd sincerely appreciate that.Working on a Soylent analogue, looking for feedback So, I'm looking to make a Soylent-like shake as optimized as reasonable against current medical research. Besides having a good balance of nutrients, I'm also looking to make something that is prebiotic, has a good balance of saturated, monounstaturated, and polyunsaturated fats (and within that, a good balance between Omega-3 and Omega-6 acids), will not make my blood sugar spike, and has some pretty-looking phytochemicals to boot. Cost is a secondary consideration. Proper health takes priority, but if I can get cheaper ingredients that are just as good, I'm all ears. The recipe may be found here: http://diy.soylent.com/recipes/gray-goo-iteration-1 (Edit: removed ingredient list and added a URL with the recipe.)Optimal Ratios of Starch, Sugar, Soluble Fiber, and Insoluble Fiber Would anybody happen to have any resources on what the ideal ratios of sugars, starch, and fiber might be? I realize this would be a very difficult (and undoubtedly very naïve) question, given that different chemicals in each of these categories do behave very differently in the body. Any generalization is bound to be rife biases and caveats. Nevertheless, I've found precious little information on the matter. Pretty much just the standard 'don't eat too many refined carbs' advice, along with the new-school 'starch is evil and fruit sugar will cure all ills' paleo drivel. Some actual scientific studies on the matter would be deeply appreciated. Or, alternatively, a breakdown of the carbs in common foods would be a wonderful starting point. (Take strawberries, for instance. For a common commercial cultivar — like Tribute — what's the ratio of, say, sucrose to mannitol to whatever other sugars we may find, as well as the ratio of amylose to amylopectin to pectin to whatever other polysaccharides we may find. Ditto for other fruit, from apples to kiwifruit. Ditto for grains, roots, and tubers.) I figure such information could be analyzed for patterns, and then compared against dietary guidelines (such as those put forth by the Harvard School of Public Health or the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies) in order to derive a reasonable (if not quite evidence-based) estimate. Partly, I'm just curious. And partly, I'm trying to optimize a Soylent-like meal replacement shake.Looking for a Laptop with Particular Hacker-Friendly Features I'm hoping to take a shot at some sysadmin and security certs soon-ish. Specifically, I'd like to start with RHCSA, LPIC-2, and the exam portion of a CISSP cert — maybe take a stab at taking a CEH course, time and money permitting — and work my way up from there. It would be nice to have a machine to poke at and practice on, as well as run attacks against my own network. My requirements are therefore a bit obscure relative to mainstream consumers. Most manufacturers only list a handful of tech specs alongside the standard marketing drivel, so my ideal machine is hard to pin down. I'd be deeply grateful if I could get a helping hand at sifting through all the fluff out there. **LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE** • Country of purchase: USA, but willing to import. • Budget range: 500 to 900 USD, amenable to a higher price if it meets my needs more closely. • Purpose: Practice for admin and security certs, attacking my own network, and general tinkering. • Screen size preference: No particular preference. Anything 12” or more, or 19” or less. • OS preference: GNU/Linux, maybe FreeBSD or Solaris. • Gaming requirements: Not intended for any gaming. • Other performance requirements: For CPU, more cores over higher speed or bigger cache; for GPU, anything CUDA-compatible, if the price is right • Brand preferences and reasons: Anything but Samsung. I hate Samsung with a passion. I do understand many manufacturers use Samsung-built components, and that’s tolerable, but I’d rather avoid a whole Samsung-branded laptop. • Any particular style that you like: Anything not gamer-oriented, if at all possible; plain and bland for me. **Which of the following qualities would you prefer?** • Long battery life -vs- Low weight -vs- High performance: Balanced • Build quality -vs- Low price -vs- High performance: Low price • Low noise/heat -vs- High performance: Balanced **List any features that are critical:** • Impeccable compatibility with GNU/Linux. I don't mind using proprietary drivers, but I'd rather not spend a lot of time pulling out my hair over some small but obnoxious compatibility issue. •• An exception to the above is the WiFi hardware. I’m planning on using my own card, since odds are, the one built in doesn’t support monitor mode or packet injection anyway. Actually, if it came without a WiFi card at all, that would be pretty sweet. • Roomy inside. I don't need it terribly sleek and portable, but I would like room to make some modest mods if needed (say, drilling holes and mounting RP-SMA connectors without a lot of fuss.) • Plastic casing. See the previous point. Milled unibody aluminum and carbon fiber feel great, but old-fashioned squeaky, rickety plastic is much easier to drill. Also, it tends to be cheaper. • As many CPU cores as are reasonable. Raw speed is nice if available, but not hugely important. As recent a chip as possible within budget would be great too. • CUDA-compatible GPU is a wonderful bonus, for GPGPU applications, if available within budget. Even a several-years-old GPU is plenty for my needs. Cheap-o integrated graphics are plenty sufficient if that’s not doable. • 8 gigs of RAM, upgradable to 16 or more. 16 gigs out-of-box if it's within budget. • Decent-enough display. I’ll be spending most of my time at the command line, so it doesn't have to be anything special, certainly not a Retina-quality IPS panel. But, a bottom-of-the-barrel TN panel with poor viewing angles will make my eyes bleed. • Decent-enough keyboard. As long as it's not complete mush, I can make do. I do actually enjoy modern chiclet-style keys, for what it’s worth. • Decent-enough trackpad. It ought to be responsive and track multitouch gestures with good accuracy. I'm amenable to separate buttons, but I do prefer a clicking trackpad. Trackpad’s size isn't a big deal. • Mini PCI-e slots. The more the merrier, but at least 1 half-length slot is essential. An MXM slot or upgradable CPU would be lovely too, but I’m not holding my breath on either of those. • At least 1 gigabit ethernet port. 2 would be awesome. I can understand ultrabooks lacking them, but they're becoming surprisingly scarce nowadays. So, yeah, definitely an off-beat feature list. So far, I've been researching every potentially interesting laptop one-by-one, and it's a slow process. Finding one similar to what I described would make my life a lot easier. I'm sure no laptop is going to nail each and every one of these points, but the closer I can find, the better. Many thanks to anyone who could offer any suggestions.[survival crafting sim][2015-ish]first person survival crafting Sim game where you're in a cabin and trying to survive against a bear? **Platform(s):** pc **Genre:** survival crafting sim **Estimated year of release:** 2015-ish. not certain **Graphics/art style:** Not sure how to answer this. voxel-ish I guess?

Watched a small part of it long ago - an acquintance was watching it in full while at work in his store, and I was shopping and ended up catching some 5 minutes of it or so. The scene I remember best is when the protagonist escapes from the farmhouse, during nighttime, using a car/RV. He was previously being tortured or victimized in some way, but I don’t remember the perpetrators. When I met my friend again, he told me that the movie ended with protagonist driving for awhile only to arrive at the exact same location. And that he then realized he was dead or in afterlife. Apparently, some demons appeared as well, or his torturers were revealed to actually have been demons from the getgo. There is a chance that the protagonist was accompanied by a woman, but I am not so sure about that.[TOMT][TV SERIES][80s-90s] english speaking show, probably not from US, description below Late eighties/early nineties. Likely Australian or British, but everything is possible. These are the details my friend and I can remember: - The plot takes place by the sea shore/beaches - One of the main characters is a burly dude with a beard (my friend claims he resembles Bud Spencer) - The show’s main theme (introduction to every episode) is some kind of whistled melody - The only scene my friend remembers is when someone had put snakes in the bathtub to scare a certain woman named Margo(?) Any help would be appreciatedDaily reminder that fish-eye effect is a thing in porn When I was younger, pornography left me with an impression that I have an ice pick for a dick. Length was never really a problem and I never felt it was important, but I kinda felt self conscious about girth (14cm/5.5inch) seeing how massive things can look in porn from the right perspective. Now I do know that averages mean little to nothing to us, I just want to point out that our pornoscopic brains tend to play tricks on us, especially when coupled with insecurity-fueled body dysmorphia. I see a lot of well-endowed guys here and over the internet in general feeling rather average because 5’3 looks like 6’3 when held in a tiny hands and recorded with 18mm lens.[TOMT][MOVIE][1990s/2000s] An action/thriller movie that has a scene of a mexican standoff in a car. This is an (American, I believe) film I watched a long ago and this scene is the only fragment that I remember at this point. Here are some additional details: - The driver (on the left) and the front seat passenger are alone in a car and holding each other at a gunpoint. I believe that the later has a pistol equiped with a suppressor. - At some point, the car abruptly brakes which breaks the passenger’s line of fire and allows driver to execute him (his death is not shown explicitly, only a view from the outside which shows front red window painted red with blood); - The passenger talks about children in a creepy manner at some point, I think he had some bad intentions in general or with some kid in particular, I’m not sure. He is probably a hitman or a psycho murderer, and I recall him as somewhat sophisticated. (Not some street gangster) - I don’t want to throw you off trail as I’m not sure - but when I try to remember what passenger looks like, the image of Philip Seymour Hoffman pops in my mind. Those are all the details that I can remember with some confidence. Thanks!Weed is magical Guys I just wanted to write this as a tribute to the god damn plant. Yesterday I was stressed, depressed, tired, unmotivated, and generally felt like shit. I went into my room and took a bong-hit of some kief my grinder had accumulated. Got high as a kite and just sat in bed watching Youtube (and porn) for a while, then went to bed. Today I woke up early in the morning with a smile on my face. Happy as fuck, motivated enough to hit the gym, sort out a bunch of problems I had, do my homework, make some bomb ass food, and now I feel great again. Don't even feel like smoking anymore, I just feel really good. That's all I wanted to say, damn this stuff is amazing sometimes.First time doing xanax, have some noob questions Hey guys, so as the title implies I got my hands on a few xans and have some questions about them. Sorry if these are \"nooby\" questions, and if I sound uninformed about the subject, I am. Answers are much appreciated though. <3 (For clarification I have never done any other benzodiazepines before, but have tried a few other drugs). &#x200B; 1. How would you describe the effect of xanax, and is it any different to other benzodiazepines? I've heard one guy describe it as the downer version of MDMA/Molly, is that accurate? 2. I have mild-medium depression and anxiety, how does xanax affect this? Does it help get rid of all the negative thoughts or will it just make me more depressed/anxious? 3. What dosage would you recommend, and could I get hooked on it after a single bar? I have a to-do list of drugs, and am kind of looking to cross xans off, not take it regularly. 4. How does the effect change if you mix it with alcohol, and how dangerous is this? 5. Is it a social drug or is it better taken alone? 6. Does it amplify music or food in the same way weed does? Thanks guys <3This is the best way I could put it into words. Is this relatable for someone?

(continues forever)Beta readers told me, the felt like my story was going nowhere. How do I fix this? Most of my beta readers didn't read the whole book because the beginning felt pointless. Here's the situation: 1. There are multiple point of views. 2. Lot's of characters are doing lot's of seemingly unrelated stuff. 3. In the end, all the plot lines connect and it all makes sense. My characters have clear goals, there's some conflict but apparently the beginning feels too disjointed, the reader expects to follow a path, but I let them explore a wold forest instead. How to I fix this without cutting all the trees or taking my reader by the hand like he's a blind kid?[Build Help] - First build, I need advice. For video editing.

I know this isn't such a big deal but after only receiving many standard refusals, one agent just sent me an email to know if the book I queried is part of a series or not. And I need help answering, I don't want to mess this up. Here's everything I could answer: (what I need is for you guys to help me decide what to say and what not to say. 1. Yes the book is part of a series. 2. It's part of a five book series. 3. Book 2 and 3 are already written/rewritten but still need to be worked on. 4. I've already planned everything up to the end (book 5) So... Should I say everything? of just that yes it's part of a series? Maybe I should answer something else? Help me! ahaha I'm way too excited and I don't want to ruin my chances by giving too much, or not enough information. Thanks edit: all the four statement are true of course, I just need to know what's expected of me.Is it okay to end my novel the worst possible way for my protagonists. My novel ends with every protagonist being fucked over by the main antagonist. By the last 20 pages you realize everything has been a set up from the antagonist to destroy the good guys. and it all worked. It's the third book of the series, the first two have bittersweet endings but this one is plain disastrous for the good guys. It clearly shows that they have been manipulated since the start and I think it might be too harsh. It's just a very depressing ending. Is that okay? Edit: I need to add, there is literally no silver-lining. Nothing good comes out of it for the protagonist. They're just fucked. The have nothing good to look forward to after that final event.External Hard Drive Problem. Windows Vista I have a WD Elements external hard drive, with lots of very important data on it, and it won't open. It used to work just fine, but it started to slow down recently (when copying backup files on it) until now. It just wont work. When I plug it in the USB drive, it starts to make clicking noise ( I'm scared it might be the clicking of death I've read about on wikipedia ). If I try to open My Computer, it suddenly freezes. As soon as I unplug the external hard drive everything gets back to normal. Edit: I've tried it on a second computer, same results. I don't know if I've given enough details about the issue so please ask if something is missing. Is my only hope to do a data recovery? If so how do I get this done? Thank YouLooking for french novel recommendations. Anyone knows good french books? (not translations) I want original french (not necessarily from France) novels. I'm trying to read both English and French Novels. I already have lots of English book but can't seem to find anything in french. books I've recently read (that I liked): The fault in our stars. Harry Potter Death and The Penguin (and the sequel) Thanks :) edit: French is my native language. 2nd edit: Woah, thank you everyone, first time posting to /r/books and I'm glad I did. I have stuff to read for ages now (I'm a slow reader)Hockey team lures Slenderman from the forest? This happened two years ago: I played in a hockey team, we were between 17 and 19 years old boys. We had a tournament in a city 5 hours away from where we lived so our team ranted two small chalet for us during the weekend. After the first game we went back to the chalet. Had supper and then started chilling, some of us wen to the forest near by to smoke and drink (not a lot since we had a game the next morning). This is where it started. Some guy said they saw something in th forest, or someone, probably just to mess with us but anyway. Everyone went to sleep and woke up the next morning. At the breakfest table one guy starts telling us that he woke up in the middle of the night and saw a tall man watching him sleep. He didn't recognize the man so he didn't move. He was paralyzed by the fear and didn't want the tall man to know he was awake. He waited to fall asleep so the man would go away. That was weird but most people didn't believe him. Then out of no where another guy from the team starts telling his side of the story. He went to bed later than the first guy, when he got into his room there was a guy sitting on his bed. The description of the guy matched the other description; tall, never seen before and dressed in white. Being really tired this guy wasn't even scared he only told the stranger to get out of his room, which the tall man did. He then went into the other room to watch the other dude sleep. That creeped out everyone. During the day following that weird night. Nothing else happened. The second night everyone had trouble sleeping. And the next day one of the guy got into a car crash. His car flipped upside down, with 3 other team mates in the car. Luckily everyone was okay but the car was a total reck.Hearing a song before it was released and the redhead girl. [dream] [SONG]: A couple years ago my favorite band at the time (hollywood undead.. Yeah I know.) was about to release a new song. 3 days before the actual song was released I had this dream in which I heard the song. I could vividly remember the song I heard but since I thought it was only a dream I didn't think of writing it down. As you guessed, when the song is finally released I listen to it for the first time and it's the exact same song. [REDHEAD]: this is pretty much the same scenario as the first story. I had this dream of a girl with red head. A couple days later while in my parent's car i see, in the passenger seat of another car that exact same girl, and she's looking at me with the same wtf face as I am. I turn around to tell my brother what just happened and the car with the girl drives of away from our car. It's important to note that I didn't feel a deja vu, I knew exactly where I heard/saw these things before.I'm pretty sure I'm okay but like still Account is old bc I made a throwaway for a post 2 months ago and just never made the post. But basically its late at night, feeling good and im thinking of a video I watched years and years ago on pornhub. Not thinking I'd get any results (which I didn't) I typed in a basic description of the video, which was \"step brother pretends to be bunny porn\" into the search bar in Google. The first thing I saw was \"child pornography is illegal, report it..\" shit. This is like totally irrational and im laughing a bit now but anyways I'm just paranoid because I feel like I'm about to get in trouble for trying to find some porn. Again totally irrational but I just feel like a federal agent is gonna walk up to my driveway tomorrow or some shit. Also, if you by any chance recognized that porn I was talking about it would be great. It was a lady who looked to be early or mid 20s blonde, and a guy in his late 20s who i dont remember what he looked like because his face was not in it for very long and the rest of the video he was in a bunny costume. Thanks a lot ladsUsing HelpX and other work exchange programs to supplement travel budget. Thinking of a huge, like year long trip. Using work exchange to basically provide for my housing. Has anyone done this? Also thinking of staying in each country max allowable time visa wise then hoping to a new place but I am concerned about cost effectivness of one way airline tickets. Can one simply return back to say first country. Anyone have experience doing this type of travel? Ideally I'd like to country hop around the globe starting from USA.Hard time trusting I’ve always had a bit of a skeptical nature since I was a kid. But then my best friend (like ride or die soul sister) in college told me after two years into our friendship that she had lied to me about being raped and having an abortion. (And I had cried with her, prayed with her, etc.) I felt like life was not what I thought it was. She’s not in my life and she’s not the point. I was so surprised and never guessed that. Ever since I guess I’ve had a really hard time trusting people. I’ve been to therapy. I’ve done emdr. It just still bothers me. Idk how to heal ? I’m not sure why I’m even writing it but… I’m paranoid that that could happen again. I’m paranoid that I could be missing red flags or ignoring them. It’s hard to trust my “intuition” sometimes because of this.Picking up the pieces every single month Every month I’m picking myself up off the (metaphorical) floor and trying to get my shit together with mental health. It’s 3 days into my period and I feel better. My thoughts are more clear. And I look back on the past week. I feel shame for the parts of me that come out. How do I deal with the guilt? I want to be consistent with my personality and sometimes it feels impossible. It feels really hard to move forward. Any success stories, compassion, or coping skills welcome!My fiancé doesn’t have sex with me often and does not initiate typically. She reassures me that it is due to her medicine and the overall intensity of the past few years. We have been through a lot together with ptsd, car accident, pandemic. So it all makes sense and I love her no matter what. AND I still have a high sex drive and a history of not allowing my sexual desire in my past due to purity culture. It’s really been hard for me to suddenly doubt whether I’m desirable to her and go through all of those old mental patterns of feeling shame and unwanted. At the beginning it was hot and heavy and I believe we both want it to get back to that but it is difficult. I feel like I maybe came on too strong in the beginning about it. I was completely new. She was my first sexual partner. I felt so new to the initiating and so did she because she’s never been with a woman. My mind likes to make me doubt and worry. I don’t like that because I want to trust her and just allow this time to be what it needs to be for us. How should I proceed? Any (kind) advice?Wrote this during a mental spiral today at work. There are days I don’t want to touch my mind with a ten foot pole. Nothing seems real and every fear has potential for truth. And I swirl over and over. Today it’s not all consuming and I’m proud of myself for keeping my feet on the ground. For letting myself take a medication to help me. For showing myself and other compassion because we’ve been thru some shit. But I’d be lying if I said my insides didn’t want to shrivel up and hide in a hole. Away from the world. Away from my what feels like a loose canon of a mind. I can hear the shame like demons in my ear. Telling me I’m different and scary. I’m not worthy of love. But today I hear them as 1:4 truths. Incapable of swallowing me whole but still chirping in my ear making my heart race. Idk if it’s the ptsd or just my humanity. Maybe my ptsd is the humanity. The fragile ness of my existence existing in a series of unfortunate circumstances. Then I guess I’m not alone. After Covid , a civil rights movement, a body altering car accident, soul exposure, and everything in between. Maybe this just means I’m right where I need to be and that the authenticity of Acknowledging this place is the growth and the victory. Im proud, I’m breathing, I’m victorious. Today is a good day. I hope someone can relate...why 343 won’t just implement a similar matchmaking interface as MCC for Infinite? I thought it would be a no brained. The matchmaking interface for MCC was brilliant. You select which playlists you want to find a game in, and that opens you up to several possibilities depending on what you selected. Selecting quick play in infinite I have a chance at team slayer, oddball, strongholds, or Capture the Flag. 9/10 times I get team slayer or oddball when I select quick play when I really just want strongholds or CTP. They should make a separate playlist specifically for objective 4v4. If I wanted to play team slayer, I would select team slayer.Best sleep supplements for getting to sleep earlier and not waking up groggy? I know people ask about sleep supplements a lot on this thread, but specifically I’m looking for a supplement that can help me get to sleep earlier in the night, whilst also not leaving me groggy when I wake up. I have health issues and I’m awaiting tests like waking cortisol. But I’m just curious if there is something safe and effective that can help me in the mean time. Currently I can’t fall asleep until about 6-8am and it’s awful. I’ve always been a night owl but my old normal sleep schedule was going to sleep at 2-3 am and waking up at 11am or 12pmI heard a jet flying over last night I live in a rural area where there is almost never any jets that fly over, and i heard one flying really low over my area and I instantly opened the window and looked outside waiting to see if bombs were gonna drop. It’s strange to me because lately I’ve been very paranoid and I’m usually not. Like it will come and go and be subtle but the past couple weeks it’s been lots of paranoid thoughts. How do I counteract these thoughts or work on this? I don’t believe myself to be schizo or anything, just a history of bad anxiety and depression.How do cannabinoids affect our liver? All I’m aware of is that certain cannabinoids inhibit the P450 enzyme of the liver. However I’m curious, do cannabinoids make your liver work harder or inhibit it from detoxing properly, or perhaps make it be sluggish? I’d hope that’s not the case considering their medicinal effects, i would like to think they are good for our livers as long as we aren’t combining with drugs and alcohol that need the P450 enzyme to be removed from the body. What are your thoughts? Is there any studies or solid facts about this NOT relating to the P450 enzyme?Are you able to tolerate fish oil capsules? I’ve been taking sports research vegan omega 3 capsules for a while not to bypass the fish part and just having the algae extract for my omega 3’s only because I know I have bad reactions to fish when I got histamine intolerance. Wondering if there is a really clean fish oil supplement you guys tolerate so that I can get more DHA+EPA for the money and dosage. Right now the current dosage per 2 capsules is 420mg DHA and 210mg EPA, which I’ve seen fish oil boasting much more than that per 2 capsules.Used to tolerate L-glutamine, now I don’t Hey guys I had success with L-glutamine in the past, my food sensitivities subsided for a while, gut was feeling great. Now Im positive my leaky gut is back and I don’t tolerate l-glutamine anymore, I react really weirdly and badly to it... so I’m not sure what else I can take to heal it. I’m very sensitive to everything and react to many things I have a histamine intolerance, potentially caused by SIBO, maybe even mast cell activation... please any help would be great thank you.Zero Point Extraction Firstly I ordered their CBD distillate, which is great stuff, contains a wide array of phytocannabinoids which gives me great effects that help my mental health greatly. I personally put it into MCT coconut oil and use it as a tincture. Then I just recently ordered some of their CBD isolate which normally shouldn’t have a scent, but it doesn’t smell similar to their distillate, not complaining, but it was note worthy. I also went ahead and ordered their CBG distillate, which has a very weird smell to it, kind of a burnt/BBQ type smell, anyone else have that problem and know why that is? Anyway I emailed them about the smelly CBG distillate and they were quick to email me back and resolve the issue, they will be sending me some CBD distillate to make up for it. I’m satisfied with the customer service, the CBD distillate is my favorite and it’s very affordable I recommend it 10/10 just for the effects and quality (can’t speak on how it vapes or dabs).So many missed opportunities to include Wario and Waluigi I can’t help but sit here and think about how many mario games in recent years have been great but have left out some of the franchises less seen characters... Wario and Waluigi. I think it’s cool how they’ve changed things up with super Mario 3D world not having to save princess peach for once, and bowsers fury where bowser actually wants to kill Mario and you take him out differently than you normally would. Then there is super Mario odyssey where they include Pauline in the game from the OG donkey Kong, and changed things up with the brudals. But I have this vague story line in my head that includes a Wario and Waluigi sort of rivalry throughout the game, I just don’t see why Nintendo hasn’t done something like it yet. Just for fun, I’ll share my idea. Starting off there is a sacred jewel stored at princess peaches castle. It’s highly powerful and when in possession it transforms you into your giga version. Wario and Walugi come around and steal this jewel. So Mario and Luigi have to go following them through worlds like you’d see in Odyssey or 3D world. Every so often you face your normal boss battles like bowsers minions, king boo maybe, some others, then in between all of that you run into Wario and Waluigi every so often as a recurring boss battle, but at the end they make a run for it with the jewel. Eventually you catch up to them... it turns out they were delivering the jewel to Bowser in return for lots of money. Once bowser gains possession it turns him into Giga Bowser and goes in full rampage mode like in bowsers fury, you then end up teaming with Wario, Waluigi, and Luigi to defeat this Giga Bowser because he’s gone insane and is destroying everything. You defeat bowser together. Afterwards wario and Waluigi double cross you and take the jewel again leading to bonus worlds/levels... once you catch up to them after however many levels the final boss battle ends with a battle against a Giga Wario. Once defeated you restore the jewel back to the princess’ castle and you put wario and Waluigi behind bars in the castle, and humanity is restored once again. Thanks for coming to my autistic Ted talkBeen dealing with GI problems for a while Hey guys, so I’ve been seeing a naturopath for a while she suspected SIBO, as well as myself, let me give you a background of my symptoms and I’d like to see if anyone else shared similar problems. So I have a histamine intolerance/mast cell activation, I react to a lot of foods and such along with chemicals and smells, deal with anxiety and depression, mood swings etc... My digestive symptoms are lots of bloating and uncomfortable gut feelings, I have to lay down a lot, I don’t get out much, have agoraphobia due to my gut problems, I get so bloated that it can be hard to breathe and stand up sometimes... Now here is where it’s very specific and interesting. I try natural antibiotics like oregano oil which helps a bit but then it causes my motility to essentially paralyze, and the only way to fix it is with probiotics the specific one I take is strain BB536. That’s the only one that doesn’t mess with my mood too much and doesn’t bloat me too much, everything else makes my mood and bloat much worse... but after a week or two I find my mood swings worse again, motility slowing down again, feeling hungry even immediately after eating a huge meal with lots of meat and carbs... (I must mention I only feel good if I eat meat, if I don’t eat meat then I might as well not eat at all). So I’m in this vicious cycle... take oregano oil to kill off bacteria... replenish with probiotic because digestion essentially stops and gets stuck if I don’t. Take probiotic for a while, start to feel better for a week or two, then start to worsen again and have to take oregano oil again to start the cycle over. It’s vicious and brutal, I feel like absolute crap every time I have to take the oregano oil. Then I feel excessively hungry and moody after taking the probiotic for a while... Can someone please chime in and help?? I feel stuck and I don’t know what to do... doctors are useless, supplements only take the edge off, but there has to be something out there to help me... thank you for whoever read all of this, means a lot.Celiac Disease Anyone here with Celiac Disease? I just had an appointment with my gastro doctor, told him about my histamine intolerance and digestive issues, and he wants to test me for celiac disease. So after that I look into Celiac Disease, and if you have it it seems it can cause things like food intolerances and damage to your small intestine and leaky gut. I’m curious if anyone here has found any relief from a gluten free diet? Seems if we can follow a gluten free diet and we have celiac the gut can heal and the other food sensitivities can go away on their own with the gluten free dietWhich Vitamin C forms/brands to take? Vitamin C is really helpful for when I eat higher histamine foods, it can knock down a reaction quickly... however there are some problems I run into... Camu Camu powder is great for me however it hurts my stomach pretty badly unfortunately... ascorbic acid derived from tapioca (NOT CORN DERIVED) has been good too, I take 2000mg and it can help symptoms but not nearly as beneficial as 1 teaspoon of Camu Camu (but the stomach symptoms are not worth it unless an emergency). Please drop below what has been the best vitamin C for your histamine issues below, with the form and the brand please, thank you.Digestion problems 3+ years clean Hey everyone, I have been 3+ years clean from benzos and I have a wide array of chronic health issues now. One of them being digestive problems, like extremely slow sluggish digestion. I was wondering if anyone else has digestive issues after coming off benzos later down the road, and how you help it? I have GI appointments soon, and I am also seeing a naturopath waiting for my natural prokinetic supplement to try, and also have Low Dose Naltrexone to try at some point.Dealing with chronic illness and feeling like a burden Hello, I am very depressed and feeling like a burden to those around me. I am unable to work due to some underlying chronic illness, things like stomach problems, and chemical sensitivities, and food sensitivities. I have no money for anything, I rely on food stamps for food, and rely on the help of others when I need to afford any treatments, or food other than what my food stamps provides. I am very juggle brained right now so forgive me, this is hard for me to reach out, as I always bottle things up. I just want to be healing and healthy again, I don’t want to be a burden and bring peoples vibes down. I was having thoughts of suicide earlier but texting the crisis chat has helped. I just came here as an extra outlet for myself. Thanks for readingIs there any logical explanation behind the symptoms I get from probiotics? Okay so I used to tolerate Bifido, and some Lactobacillus strains just fine, now I can’t tolerate the two kinds I used to take, so I switched to a different brand of just Bifido strains with no fillers, and what happens is after a couple of days I notice my mood gets worse from taking them and my stomach emptying speeds up and I’m constantly hungry. So what happens is I end up killing them off with some oil of oregano to stop these symptoms, however I’m sure a normal person would just stop taking the probiotics but I end up taking them again because when I kill too much it also has a similar effect where it effects my mood, but then makes my motility really slow to the point where I feels like things are getting stuck. If anyone can help in anyway at all that would be so much appreciated. Doctors don’t seem to understand what’s going onThick books with many issues of comics inside? Hey guys I’m not apart of this community, but I figured this was the place to ask this question. I remember as a kid I had a thick book of Punisher comics, like it was one big book but had many different comics within it, and I can’t seem to find them anywhere? I would prefer to buy them this way that way as I am not hugely into comic books however I enjoy reading and looking through them. Can anyone tell me what those are called, or know what I’m talking about? Thanks!One year ago today, a lot of us illegally listened to Fear Inoculum for the first time I was on Facebook and saw on my memories about how there was the big ordeal here on reddit of the guy who stole a copy of the album and went to Vegas to meet some guy to upload it to the internet.... it was like a whole journey for this community following this guy, and when I was finally able to get the file off of Discord, I downloaded it as fast as I could and started listening, I couldn’t believe my ears when Pneuma came on, I was like THIS IS REALLY IT... and I cried from how beautiful it was, and cried on basically every song after the title track... what a day to remember.... never forget 08/25/19Questions Question regarding probiotics Are all probiotics made equally? Let me phrase this in a way that makes sense to my situation. If I buy a probiotics supplement with say bifidus bacterium from one brand, and then buy the SAME strains from another brand are they generally the same quality (or made equally)? Or is there certain brands that are made better or differently making them more obsolete? I take this probiotic off amazon called Lifted Naturals mood super strains and it’s under 30 dollars for 60 caps... which is pretty cheap and they help me feel good for a while but then I always run into this wall where I start to feel shitty from them and have to take oregano oil to kill them off and then take them again to feel balanced. I’m wondering if maybe the probiotics I get are just crappy quality, or what’s going on? After days of taking them I start to get this starving feeling a lot even after I have eaten plenty of food, I take oregano oil to kill them off and bam I feel full. Mind you the strains I get are for lowering histamine because I have histamine intolerance, so I have to stick to very specific strains of bacteria for this condition. Thanks in Advance for anyone who can give me some solid information.Question regarding probiotics Are all probiotics made equally? Let me phrase this in a way that makes sense to my situation.

Edit: I was looking at Ghosthacks sample packs, anyone try these? $35 for a bunch of different samples seems like a good deal, with a 30 day money back guarantee. Like I said I’m new so forgive me if I seem obliviousFemale singer: sounds like Beyoncé genre: pop probably early 2000’s Ah ee A Oh it’s a pretty fast pace pop song, sounded like beyonce singing but i don’t think it was her, the chorus goes “ahh-ee-A-oh, Ahh-ee-A-oh” don’t remember any of the words. I heard this song on an American Dad episode, can’t remember the episode, but if I did I’m sure I would know the song now, but maybe one of you have heard the song. I feel stupid for even trying to ask here but it’s worth a shot right? https://voca.ro/a1a6j5FWlaPDepression and slow gut motility caused by hypothyroid? I was recently diagnosed hypothyroid in November, I have had gut motility issues and depression, and I noticed once I started thyrocsin these issues almost immediately subsided, does hypothyroid cause these? Also thyrocsin is a natural supplement for those of you that don't know, I'm noticing one side effect though and that's like \"too much\" energy, like to where I'm wired and hyper, and not so much my self, like maybe a couple steps up from where I would like to be energy wise. My naturopath said this is the natural vitamin approach before trying something called natureroid I think was what it's called? Anyone heard of this or take it? Please let me know thanks Edit: all chemicals were normal except TSH was really highDescending So it starts off kinda sounding like it could be waves crashing on the shore and at the end as well the same noises... but anyone think the middle section where Adam uses the volume swells also sounds like waves crashing on shore? I was high last night and like realizing a lot of the way Tool writes is to make you feel like you are somewhere else if you really choose to hear it that way... kinda like how Invincible makes you feel like it could be a warrior marching on the part Adam is playing in 7 and Danny is playing in 4Possible Descending meaning Was just listening to the lyrics whilst stoned, and thinking about the lyrics behind fear inoculum, I think Descending has something to do with the band descending out of the spotlight (despite the ever growing fan base and popularity). Just as Invincible has the line \"struggling to remain relevant\" I feel like this whole album has a general theme about Tool themselves growing older (just as some of the members have alluded to in interviews) obviously the songs have multiple meanings, and can serve many purposes, for example fear inoculums lyrics give me a freeing feeling from anxiety, etc... but it just seems the theme is about these guys as a whole growing older Curious if anyone agrees or disagrees with me, just wanted to share my interpretation!FoH CC processing I was just informed by one of the owners that Fields of Hemp just got approved for a new credit card processing company and will go into effect sometime next week if all goes accordingly! You can still make orders via phone call or email and pay with venmo which is what I did, but need to be discreet with the notes you leave when paying... they do have a little bit of smalls left of pineberry, lifter, and grumpy grandpa. Edit: no smalls on the website, ask them over the phone or email if you want to order themWhere to buy large quantities of decent quality smalls on the low? Hey guys I need your help, I am looking for a good vendor to buy larger quanties, anywhere from a QP to a pound or more, it doesn't have to be large nugs, but I don't want trim either, I want it to be decent quality too, some of it will be for smoking, making edibles, and home made pain balm, any leads would be great thanks :) Preferably some one with test results as well! Don't want any pesticides, and would like to know percentages!What supplements to take? What are all of the supplements I need to take to normalize with the two MTHFR gene mutations? As far as I know I just need B12, folate, B6 (p5p), and B2 (riboflavin), but wanted to check here to see if there is anything else I need additionally to get methylating properly... Side note: on top of having both gene mutations I also have histamine intolerance, and digestive issues (possibly SIBO, or leaky gut) and I imagine these issues are all tied together (at least from what I've read around the internet).Problems taking methyl-b12 and methylfolate In my experience I can't tolerate methyl b12 or methyl folate as they cause anxiety and agitation, mood swings, overall unease, etc... so I take a supplement that is strictly just hydroxocobalamin and folinic acid... the question is do I need to take more of said supplement than normal since I have the mutation or is the suggested dose sufficient enough. That would 1,000mg B12 + 800 mcg folinic acid (plus I take another 1,000 mg of b12 on top of that per day HYDROXOCOBALAMIN)Possible steps to heal histamine intolerance once and for all Ensure proper methylation, heal leaky gut, rule out SIBO, and ensure no nutrient deficiencies. SIBO is fairly easy to treat with the proper supplements, things like garlic extract (allicin), oregano extract (not oregano oil, oil of oregano), berberine, and Neem.... don't even need to bother with prescription antibiotics, people end up having to use herbal antibiotics anyway down the road after prescription treatment. Methylation, main things you need to take is vitamin B12 (any b12 will do as long as it's not Cyanocobalamin), methylfolate or folinic acid (not folic acid), vitamin b6 (p5p is the one you want), and vitamin b2 (riboflavin). Ensuring methylation is up to par is especially important if you have an MTHFR gene mutation. Additional methylation support would be betaine hydrochloride or Trimethylglycine (TMG) L-methionine, and SaM-e And as far as leaky gut goes, L-glutamine, MSM, and Marshmallow root powder, along with a bifido bacteria probiotic supplement will do the job. (I used Custom Probiotics D-lactate free formula).... marshmallow root is not only soothing and healing to your stomach and gut, but is also an antihistamine as well, which works well for us histamine intolerance folks, since we're prone to stomach issues and reactions when ingesting thingsCbd tolerance break? Is it worth taking a one or two day tolerance break or do I just need to continue taking the dosage that I am taking? Currently I am taking 2ml of 1000mg tincture which comes out at about 67 mg cbd, my body weight is only 145 pounds, so that's more than what they suggest for my weight. Should I continue my dosage, or should I consider a tolerance break? In order to feel relaxed and able to fall asleep that is the dosage I take... I was only taking half of that about a week or so agoCBDistillery I recently have been using the THC free tincture from them, I first ordered the 500mg bottle which works great but I used the whole thing within 7 days, so I ordered the 1000mg bottle, should be in the mail tomorrow, and then I decided it's cheaper to buy the isolate itself and mix it with MCT oil myself to make a stronger tincture for less money. So I ordered 2 grams of what is called on their website the \"CBDelicious\" which seems to just be isolate but for making edible concoctions.... I'm just curious What's the difference between the \"CBDab\" and \"CBDelicious\" they both look like cbd isolate but the CBDelicious is 2 dollars cheaper and marketed for making your own cbd concoctions...THC FREE CBD TINCTURE WORKS FOR HISTAMINE INTOLERANCE Last time I tried CBD it was with the cbdistillerys full spectrum 1000mg tincture and I had bad results lots of anxiety and what not.... recently saw they have the thc free tincture on their website so I decided to buy the 500mg, since all it is is isolate and coconut oil.... well it's safe to say it's working out quite well! Besides the low blood pressure, which I counteract with Himalayan salt mixed with spring water.... it's helping my anxiety a great deal! I just wanted to share this in case anyone else in this community has histamine issues! This is pretty amazing considering I can't hardly tolerate very many foods! I'm so happy that it doesn't make me react.... after searching 'histamine' within the community here and a bit of reading it seems I'm not the only one who has experienced this due to histamine issues.UFO sighting two summers ago My friend and I were driving the back roads on the outskirts of our hometown Forest Grove, OR.... as we were driving and I look out into the distance, and over near the next town over (Gaston, OR) I see a bright yellow light and the light is going up and down very fast, and it had to be going up and down at least 100 feet or more considering how much it was doing it and how far in the distance it was, it looked unreal! It was traveling in squiggly \"S\" formation up and down and up and down.... but by the time I was able to get my phone out to record we were behind the trees and my friend didn't see so he probably thought I was just seeing shit (he was the one driving so had to pay attention to the road) by the time we turned around to drive back and see it was gone.... anyway, I was wondering if anyone else has had a sighting like this before? Let me know, much appreciated and thanks for reading!Dabbing DMT Winter of 2017 I was desperate for a psychedelic life changing experience I was severely depressed, poor, no money, too depressed to work Grandma gave me 20 bucks to spend on whatever at the time, so I said \"I'm gonna look for some LSD\" Hit up my buddy who usually only has LSD, says \"I don't have LSD but I have DMT\" and immediately I said I want $20 worth. I had done DMT before but never fully blasted off, and like they always say \"dmt will find you when it's the right time\" so I got right on that. Fast forward. It's the weekend, I'm staying at my safe house where no worries or potential negative triggers around. My aunt had a nectar collector so I decided to try a little bit through that. Prior to that I had smoked some cannabis, that was NOT a good idea. When I did the DMT I laid back and the suddenly felt like I was literally going to die, I was literally hanging on to my hair because I did not want to be shot out of my body, and during that time I was rolling on the ground fading in and out of reality see everything change from what it is normally and then break down into shapes and eventually into one singular triangle, and it felt like this triangle was laughing/angry/disappointed at me, but before I knew it, the trip wore off and I was fine. I attributed my unpreparedness with a lack of knowing how to let go before hand and also smoking cannabis before hand, I believe it was a sativa, so that surely did not help my situation. Fast forward to next day I used my buddies oil rig with the Omni-nail, I didn't weigh the dose, and I ended up dabbing too little. I was ready I started to see the aliens welcome me from above but they were like \"oh no you have try again\" (they didn't actually say that but I felt like that's what was being communicated to me). So I gave my self time for the tolerance to go away. Went and sat on the edge of my aunts bed, this time weighing on a scale .08 of a gram (80 mg) it was most likely more than 80 but, it was less than 90 mg... and you only need 50 mg to blast off. I wanted to ensure a blast off though in one hit. Heated up the nail, got my scoop of crystals ready, waited for the nail to cool to a low temp whilst shaking from nervousness and excitement, then as soon as I felt it hit a good temp I dropped that shit on there, then carb capped it and inhaled the big cloud of chemical tasting vapor, sucked it in as deep as I could and then held it in until I couldn't any longer and as I was about to exhale I fell back against the mattress and my eyes closed, as the exhale was happening I had left my body behind in an instant, there was no blast off, I went straight there. I felt as if I had woken up in a dimension that felt so similar, I thought I was home and I could hear my mom talking to me, like I was in a room but everything was so bright and colorful, and the language could not be understood, that scared me at times because I thought I had just woken up somewhere in this dimension... then suddenly I started coughing hard and gagging, in that dimension a sort of cup appeared for me to throw up in (it was only stomach fluid, I hadn't eaten yet) but in reality I threw up on the floor in the room I was in, luckily nothing major or concerning probably just from the huge hit I took. After that I laid back down and closed my eyes and it was like dark now but still very colorful, then Suddenly this woman like presence appears before me, she felt like mom, she felt familiar, she was comforting. She showed me around the realm, I remember towards the end she told me if I wanted to stay or go any further I had to die and leave the other reality behind and I said \"no, no it's okay, I'm okay, I wanna go back now\" and at that instant I saw how life worked and DNA structures just random things like that but happening so fast I cannot even remember or explain exactly what it was, but I saw lots of unexplainable figures that she was showing me and then after that she the disappeared and I entered a start of complete nothingness and blackness and then saw earth for a flash and then nothingness and blackness and then a flash of earth again back and forth, then I started seeing pictures of life on earth like humans, animals, plants, trees, oceans, everything, almost as if I was thinking myself back into existence somehow. Then at an instant it felt like I was reborn into my body, rather than shooting into my body like in astral projection. It felt like I came out of a womb within my own body, and I started feeling the blankets around me and I just started laughing and crying and just couldn't stop saying \"wow\" over and over again. With my eyes open I was seeing geometric patterns on the walls for about a minute and I felt weak, then about a minute later I could get up and walk about, and I hugged my friends, then proceeded to hug the walls, because 3D felt so strange after that... 3D tripped me out for a long time after that, just the concept itself and seeing it with my own eyes after have gone to another dimension. After that every time I smoked cannabis it made me feel like I was tripping, not in a good way either. So I ended up becoming sober after that trip, and that was the end of all drug use for me. It's fall 2018 and I still haven't fully integrated this experience and idk if it's even doing me justice talking about it here, but I felt like sharing as much as I could. Thanks for reading, sorry if it was hard to read. I have CFS, so mental clarity isn't the best right now.Stomach related? I have had stomach problem for a long time, ever since I can remember sometime when I was a kid. I was on proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers for acid reflux for a while because I have/had hiatal hernia. But now my food seems to just go into my stomach and sit there for a while and make it hard to breathe from bloating (unless I use a heating pad then I can hear it and feel it start to me) but I also have a severe histamine intolerance. Wondering what stomach problem it would be that would be causing this? Gastritis maybe?TOOL recording update (for those unaware) Okay so i have been seeing way too much doubt about the new album from Tool fans everywhere, and I feel like I am explaining where they are at every time I come across it, because I just dislike ignorance and that's my nature.... people saying either \"it sounds like they are still writing it\" or just a complete doubt of an actual new Tool album.... so here's an update! For those of you who follow Adam Jones on Instagram or their producer Joe Baressi you probably know what I'm about to say then.... -DANNY CAREYS PARTS ARE DONE, DRUMS WERE FINISHED BEFORE their little instrumental tour clinic thing. -JUSTIN CHANCELLORS PARTS ARE DONE, bass was finished shortly after the return home from their clinic tour, there was pictures posted of Justin's rig with a caption reading \"bass parts are done!\" -ADAM JONES IS IN THE STUDIO CURRENTLY! If you've been following Adam Jones on Instagram you'll see he's been posting pictures of Amps he's using in the studio along with cool unique pedals, etc. lots of hints that he's in the studio, along with their producer Joe Baressi on his Instagram he posted all the Amps Adam is using in the studio, which is a pretty massive selection, but if you are aware of how 10,000 Days was recorded, there was no shortage of guitar amps for that album either, the DIEZEL VH4 is only one of many amps he's using. For those of you unaware, ADAM JONES also likes to take his SWEET ASS TIME on recording the guitar parts, so this could be a few more weeks, a month, or two months before the guitar tracks are done, but they are being recorded currently! -MAYNARD will record his vocal parts after the guitar parts are finished, and also after he is not busy with his wine which he is busy with through now until October... not to mention he also has some A PERFECT CIRCLE tour dates left to do.... The album is coming together ladies and djents! Be patient..... it really is coming! You can't rush perfection! THAT IS ALL. Thanks for reading.Seeing humans as aliens on LSD + Shrooms It was about 2 years ago, I took about 400 micrograms of lsd and 1-1.5 grams of Shrooms together. I remember the come up being very intense, I was not scared at all, I just remember it feeling like I was going down a roller coaster, kinda tense, my buddies were driving me up to a place in the Tillamook forest out here in Oregon. I recall having some very emotional disturbances about myself on the way up their but was able to let go of them. By the time we got up in the woods I was starting to have visuals and the trees had sacred geometry on them, the leaves looked fractally and colorful. When we got to the top of the mountain we got out of the car, and Shpongle was playing. And it all made sense that Shpongle was made to listen to while tripping, and I could hear things I never heard in the music before. As I walked around I noticed that the plants were kinda reaching for the sun, it was almost like I could see the plants loving the sun (very hard to put into words) but they look like they were putting \"their hands\" up toward the sun. All of a sudden I started peaking and I looked out over the hills and could see a grid, that's right, a grid... just like if you took grid paper and laid it over everything it looked like everything was all perfectly aligned including the trees, plants everything. Nothing looked out of place, it almost looked unnatural because of how perfectly aligned everything was. Not only was there a grid but also it contained the flower of life sacred geometry shape as the formation of the lines of the grid. Then once I admired that for a while, I started to think about aliens, and how I wanted to meet them, and if I will ever meet aliens, now is the time, and I thought to myself in this moment \"I'm going to meet aliens right now, they are going to show up\" then all of a sudden right after that, people on their ATV's drove by and immediately realized that humans ARE the aliens we are always thinking about, and after I realized that I told my friends, and next thing I know like a veil lifted and one friend had three eyes and looked like one type of alien and the other looked scaley and had snake eyes (reptilian like) I thought it was insane, but I told them they are aliens and the reptilian looking one just couldn't believe it while the other agreed that he was an alien, and has always felt that way about himself.... moving forward later in the trip as it starts to come down, when I go out in public I see all people as aliens, and I go visit my aunt, and she looks like a snake person too. Straight up had serpent eyes, snake tongue, scaley skin and all. I will never forget that trip, I have never publicly talked about this but wanted to put it here for people to see! Let me know if anything like this has ever happened while tripping! Thanks for reading.Severe anxiety and depersonalization Anyone here get horrible anxiety and even depersonalization from histamines? I know high histamine is linked to schizophrenia but I don't ever hallucinate that I'm aware of. But sometimes it feels like it gets close to that with how depersonalized, anxious, and \"out-of-it\" I feel. Currently I have agoraphobia from so many panic attacks, so it's almost impossible for me to go out and see a doctor to get help with this. I react to so much foods and supplements, it's hell.Good quality vita 2000 grip Hey guys, I'm looking for a good quality vita grip. Of course I would like hori or nyko but my wallet disagrees, and they are way overpriced from what they used to be anyway.

So to paint a picture, me (m16) and my buddies(around 15 to 19) are all chilling and my friend whips out a bag of adderall. it’s the 20mg white vyvanse ones and this is like the 2nd time i’ve done this type. I take 2 and wait a bit smoke a bit of weed and I didn’t really feel anything. I had a feeling of slight euphoria and an all around good mood. Then I took another one 2 and half hours later because I didn’t really feel anything the. And now an hour or 2 later I somewhat feel the adderall high. Is there any reason why the high is somewhat delayed?crazy QAnon family. i posted this on r/crazyparents but i felt like this was the right place for it. so me being a ancom teenager i am i am pro mask but my step mom and grandparents aren’t. my grandparents aren’t as bad and i still love for who they are even with their crazy beliefs but my step mom is really bad. her and her parents are the usual “mask are killing you blah blah black people blah blah” and i genuinely hate it. i can’t even really talk to either my step mom or her parents just because they bring that up at any chance it seems. i really miss my step mom supportiveness but but now she’s became so racist, homophobic and transphobic. i wish i could just have some regular parents.i just want to be ok i just want all the confusion anger and sadness to stop. i’m tired. i know that it might get better in the future but i’m not doing ok now. i don’t care what i’m gonna be feeling in 5 years from now. fuck i really don’t know how much i can take. if there is a god why would they put us through these things? why would our loving eternal father put us through such torment? does he hate us? what have i done to deserve these terrible things happen to me? i was a child who just wanted to live a semi good life and now i’m this? a mentally ill drug addicted faggot? is this what god has put my role as? if god really does have a plan then why did those horrible things happen to me and so many other innocent kids. just why.Moment of silence I'm unsure if this is allowed in this sub sorry if not. I just wanted to complain/vent a little about it. Last night on my way to DnD it occured to me someone stole my dicebag out of my car. They went through everything but the only thing missing was my dice. Besides them throwing a bunch of my things all around nothing else seems to be missing. The worst part about this for me isn't that I have to buy new dice. Who doesn't love picking out new dice, amiright? What's bothering me is the fact I had gotten a set for every character I have played and now they're all gone. I've still got the character sheets to my old characters. I rather enjoyed looking at the old dice and remembering some of the crazy things they had gotten my characters through (or into.) Now I am just hoping the person who stole them will actually be using them. Nothing bothers me more than thinking about my dice just getting tossed aside or even worse tossed out. If i keep telling myself they're being used by a group of new DnD players it won't bother me as much. I've just got the feeling that isnt the case. Tl;Dr Someone stole my dice and I'm sad. Edit: Reddit is full of amazing people https://imgur.com/mQsdqSjWhere would the best place to start for someone who knows nothing about computers? I (26M) didn't have acess to a computer until i was around 13 or 14 years old. This made me unenthusiastic about having to do any type of school work on computers all through highschool. I am now interested in how computers work and would maybe like to try and build one for myself. I am aware of the other subreddits like r/buildapc but that is getting a little out of my depth. If anyone could point me towards a good source of information i would be extremely appreciative!Question about prescription. So I asked my regular family practitioner to up my dose and she basically said no, and that also I wasn’t supposed to be taking it everyday. On my prescription it says take once daily, she was saying it said as needed. So anyways she referred me to a psychiatrist and I go next week, do you think the psychiatrist will continue me on my current 1mg dosage? It’s really helped me get a job and my anxiety and panic attacks are almost non existent. Any advice or tips would be appreciated. ThanksParents fighting(cheating) I found out that my dad is now cheating or seems to be on my mom. Dads 53, moms 46, they have had hiccups in the past, my mom was talking to a guy across the world, but then my mom figured out that he was getting boobie pics from his ex wife’s sister before my mom even sent texts to that man across the world. Now whenever my mom leaves, for instance she went to my great grandmas funeral and that’s when my dads decides to text other woman. I already know one of the woman, her number, address. He can’t admit to my mom that he feels some type of way about their relationship. I don’t know what to do, I just decided to come on here and share if anyone could help me that would be good. ThanksThinking about joining the masons, I live in central Texas, and a good buddy of mines dad is a master. Thinking about joining the masons, I live in central Texas, and a good buddy of mines dad is a master. My great grandfather (grandmothers dad) was a Shriner. I still live with my parents but I feel a great opportunity coming from this for some reason. Feel guided towards it if that makes sense. Any tips? I would like to chat on PM with a fellow mason who could kinda give me a rundown on what I should know, or what I should expect from it. Thanks - HunterMaybe this will help someone So I would call myself a TI under circumstances, pretty hard to explain, I get gangstalking and I get what it looks like especially with groups of people. To me gangstalking is to make others feel inferior, which is bullying. So as long you know they are actually the inferior ones, I wouldn’t worry. Most TIs have a something special in their DNA. Awaken that part of you to have powers 10x stronger then perps. If you get too complicated and in depth with this, you will suffer. If you simply look at them like bully’s, you can move right past em. Don’t freeze around the peeps! That’s how they continue to drag you in!Tripping Later Aye everyone I’m tripping later I haven’t tripped in like a month and a half, I’ve taken plenty of tabs, one thing I don’t like about acid is it makes me feel a bit more materialistic, makes me feel awesome don’t get me wrong. I want to have a very good introspective trip that will show me how to deal with everyday life, I have trouble with getting bored and have a dull sense of humor which is fine, but I don’t flow to the neurotypicals way of thinking, definitely feel alienated and that’s what I want to try and fix with this trip. Any ideas on what questions should I ask? Thanks againTripping Tonight... have a question. So I’m tripping tonight, I haven’t tripped in about a month, but I feel like I forgot what’s it’s like. Once it starts kicking in will I be used to it again like I was before? I’ve tripped plenty of times, I just don’t want anything unexpected you know, I’ll be by myself like I always have. Since my last trip I feel like my perception is very concrete but I would like to change it up a bit. I’ve tripped many times but I’m just kinda nervous idk y lol. Will I be fine if I’ve dropped over 50 tabs before? I’m in a safe place at my house, just don’t want any crazy thoughts that stick with me when it ends you know. Any advice is welcome, thanks!Question Hey I’m wondering if I could already be practicing occult knowledge thru my thoughts, I have a very different view on the world, I see many signs, I can see the spirit in people through the eyes. It’s this weird sense I have and can see the world thru a different lense. I see time like 11:11, I’m usually a bit on edge and paranoid but not very bad just lingering thoughts. I know I’m not psychotic, but I’ve had things happen like reading things before they happen and knowing what will come to me based off the energy I give. I also don’t like how I know what people are going to say and react to me I want to secretly practice this around people but they always seem to judge and there’s been moments when I felt good and no paranoia just good feelings and everything goes by smooth the interactions and everything.Bought a car without title My bf bought a car and the previous owner did not have the title. Im trying to get it registered in his name and all the legal requirements but need some help. I have a bill of sale from when our seller(B) bought it from the previous person(A)... i have a notice of transaction in person A's name, i have a partially filled out application for replacement title in person B's name, i have a notice of sale or transfer of a vehicle filled out with person A and B's name, and i have a statement of lien satisfaction filled out in person A's name. The car has expired oregon plates. Im creating a to do list of what needs to happen for everything to be straightened out... heres my list so far: Replace title Replace license plates(& renew tags) What all needs to be done? This is confusing... Car was bought in OR but we live in WAIm pretty sure he cheated/ is cheating on me Weve been dating for 8 months, living with each other the most part of the last 2 years. I have consistant paranoia that hes going to cheat on me instead of breaking up with me. He always assures me that he will let me know... Tonight i went through some of his stuff and tho there is no hard proof, all the signs are there. Nudes(which has never bothered me before), kissy faces, and meetups. I told him if i found out that he was cheating on me i would break up with him but i dont want to. One part of me wants to just say there was no hard evidence so just leave it until there is, the other part of me is tired of feeling like paranoid when there really are red flags. I knew it was too good to be true.Im afraid that you arent straightforward to me Me(24f): Im afraid that you arent straightforward to me. Him(24): Im straightforward when it matters. I guess thats all that matters... that hes straightforward when it matters... but what if our ideas of \"when it matters\" is different? What if i think it matters all the time? Or am i being controlling wanting to know everything all the time? Is it unrealistic to expect someone youve been dating for 8 months to just say it how it is no matter if \"it matters\" or not? I just need some honest perspective because ive always been the kind of person to open up and be 100% honest 100% of the time. But hes not like that, but he seems to have my best interests in mind. Im starting to become paranoid. Tl;dr: boyfriend for 8 months says he is straightforward when it matters and i wish hed be straightforward all the time. Need an outside perspective.My SO has Rheumatoid Arthritis but doesnt like to talk about it I believe they were diagnosed with it when they were a teenager. Its gotten worse over the years and even though theyre only 24 they get really stiff and have a difficulty walking. It gets worse after they sit still for a while. This year they said that the winter officially affects their RA. I worry about them and dont know very much about it at all. Their mom said that once they had a flair up where their eyes went bloodshot and they almost lost their vision but they have never mentioned anything about it. They dont like people to see them as handicapped which i understand but i really worry about them since i plan to have them in my future... I guess what id like from you guys are resources where i can learn more about RA or perhaps you have some insight on the subject. Things i would like to know are: The life expectancy of people with RA? Does the age diagnosed (like how early the symptoms present themselves) affect the person's life expectancy? What kinds of things can happen in a flair up? What are things I, as their SO, can watch out for or do to help? Is it usually a gradual worsening or can it get bad all of a sudden? If you have RA can it ever go away or is it pretty much guaranteed to get worse and worse? Also, it seems like they have scars (like darker patches of skin maybe not scars) along the spine on their back but every time i bring it up it gets dismissed. Could this have been a flair? Thank you for taking this time and reading my post.Dont tell me your opinion. Just tell me you hear me. Dont tell me what you think about my situation. Your only hearing one part of my side of the story and you dont know all the good he has done for me. I just want a backboard to bounce off of. ~Its a good thing I am there for me when nobody else is.~ ~Leave me waiting~ ~You gave me a time. I thought youd make that time but the whole day has passed and you didnt say a word.~ I cant tell if im just paranoid. Yesterday i was really upset and i called him at work, even though i know hes always busy there. Sometimes i just get so low i am not sure if i can climb out of the hole without help. So i called him. He was busy and said \"give me an hour.\" I made it through the hardest part by telling myself that he was going to call soon and it was going to be okay. An hour passed, thats ok. He probably got held up and hes always late.... then i go to work, expecting a call at some point... and then i get off work and go home. Hes home but i dont go say hi cuz im upset with him. After a few hours i go in and talk to him and let him know that i had a really hard day and that it hurt that he never called when he said he would. He passed out in the other room and i couldnt sleep so i went in there with him. In the morning he called me to the other bed to cuddle. I cuddle because i need comfort. He starts to get frisky but i tell him not today for the first time. I just dont feel the love. He got up and left for work without saying goodbye 💔 when he knows that that's a thing for me. Maybe he forgot in his rush to not be late (which he probably would have been had we continued) In the past ive broken up with someone based on what someone said about my situation and i have a lot of regret. But I know i cant stop anyone from commenting what they think... Im just sad and i am afraid to talk to any of my friends about it because of this exact thing. I feel so lonely and sometimes i think he doesnt love me.Depressed that i have few friends so im trying to be friends with myself I have anxiety so its hard for me to get out sometimes but then when im ready to go out and i invite 8 people i think might want to go with me and all of them end up bailing on me including my boyfriend and people who initially said yes. So i vent about it here, hoping to get some feedback and literally one person looks at it. But im trying to get past that. I need to be my own best friend. Too often i put myself down or say to someone im dumb. Recently ive started to get mad with myself. It helps if i think of myself as a whole separate person. Like split personalities kinda. I have to stand up for me like i would stand up for a friend. Because just because people around me dont, doesnt mean that i dont deserve it! I deserve to be cared about and i deserve to have someone stand up for me when im being put down... Ive always been my worst enemy but now i want to be my own best friend.As long as it doesnt affect you, its fine, right? He acts like he cares but then he falls off the radar and he doesnt even realize hes left me lonely. I have no friends except for him but weve barely talked in a week. I get dressed up hoping to go out and nobody will go to the haunted house with me. He says he will go with me even though he hates haunted houses because its his \"job\" and he \"doesnt want to be unemployed\" as my boyfriend. He said he would go today since yesterday didnt work out but hasnt brought it up or forgot. Im stuck at a dead end, shitty job. I dont know what to do with my life and im already 18k in debt and student loans scare the shit out of me because ill spend all that money studying for something that im going to do the rest of my life but what if i hate it? I want to reach out to people but i am afraid of being pushy and i dont want fake friends who just feel sorry for me. I want to tell him how sad i am but he only cares when it affects him.I need music to keep going Im hoping that some of you have some music that helps you through rough times that youd be willing to share. Sometimes I get an idea in my head and it makes me so fucking sad that i cant control the tears and my thoughts overwhelm me. Everything is bad and i cry alone next to my sleeping boyfriend. (I could wake him up but theres really nothing he could do for me tonight.) Music affects me on such a deep level. I dont know why but i think it doesnt affect other people nearly as strong. Ill listen to music and feel the lyrics on such a deep level and ill ask someone close to me to listen to it but i dont think others can tune in to the mood of the song like i can. It makes me feel pretty alone sometimes. Anyways. Im getting side tracked... ive started making an uplifting playlist to help me get out of those dark times. Sort of like a playlist of songs im singing to myself... because i am really the only person in the entire universe that understands me. So if i use the fact that music affects me so deeply to help pull me out of those dark times... im hoping that will help me take care of myself. This is my playlist so far. Its far too short with 11 songs though. Please help me find more music. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUTUFUPm0HApmoYysjH7yu7OkogiIHKxo If, by some chance, someone going through the hell that is in the mind and music affects them strongly as it does me, i hope the above playlist helps them. \"I feel you\" by Kaskade, Zip Zip Through The Night & Penguin https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=Q48HDZexHMc&feature=share \"Listen im a lot like you. Just a different shade of blue.\"This game may not be for me Sorry for the rant. I am just terrible in arenas. I've played an assassin and had a great time leveling up. Even the open world PVP was really fun. I'd get ganked, and I'd get them back. I stepped into arenas and had a really easy time going up to 1500. But as soon as I hit 1500, it was all Blade Dancers and Summoners. They are both just a little too much for me to deal with, because I am bad. I do generally just buy founder packs about halfway through leveling, because I feel my money will help. I even did that with Skyforge and quit right as I realized it was a cash grab and was convincing myself I was having fun, instead of actually having fun. But with Blade and Soul, I was hesitant and avoided getting a pack until I got to the end game. Now that I hit level 45 arenas and am facing the same thing over and over, and not having any luck. I am thinking of throwing in the towel. Maybe I'll keep my eyes open for the level 50 patch, but we'll see what happens. Thank you for the enjoyable leveling process though.Another \"what to upgrade\" thread. I am currently sitting on an AMD FX-6300 and a GTX760. My wife has allowed me the option of upgrading. So currently I am trying to decide if I should get a new: Mobo/CPU combo i7 4790(http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=9162311&SRCCODE=WEBGOOPA&scid=scplp1525466&gclid=CKuRidvXp8kCFY-Cfgod100HqQ). I might also consider going for an i5, but that's only if I really want to budget in the graphics card as well. Or GTX960 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VX1MJQ8?m=A2L77EE7U53NWQ&qid=1448316285&ref_=sr_1_15&s=warehouse-deals&sr=1-15). I mainly use my computer for gaming (POE, D3, WoW, Hearthstone), but am currently trying to shake it up with a few other games to really put some wow-factor back into my gaming. Any advice or ideas are more then welcome.Question about the new POE Temp League Does anyone have a tentative date? A good friend and I are planning on meeting for the first time, and we want to coordinate it so he is at my house and ready to game as the new temp league starts. There are a couple of other things we're trying to work around, and having a date would make it so we could go full blown and schedule away. I think it's safe to assume right around 2 weeks after the one-month ends, but I want to be more certain. Any help is appreciated. Thank you.My two-cents about people complaining about lack of variety Diablo 3 has always had a lot of variety, from the skills you choose to the items you use. One thing that most people don't understand is there is a difference between variety and competition. You can play whatever build you want and you have the ability to get to certain GRs/Torments. Just because every build can't hit GR65+ doesn't mean there's a lack of variety. If you stop looking at the leaderboards, your imagination can get stretched quite far.flair:Hardware I have a question about upping the graphics on my computer So I am kinda at a weird spot with my computer. I have a decent rig, I wouldn't say it's weak, but I wouldn't say it's budget either. I spent alot of my time playing games, and things look good, but they don't wow me. I am wondering if someone can give me a bit of help with maybe Nvidia Control Panel. I am thinking my problem lies within me actually setting some things up in Nvidia Control Panel and not with my actual hardware. But any direction would be really helpful. Currently running: GTX 760 AMD FX-6300 6Core @ ~3.8GHz 64bit Windows DDR4 @ 8192MB (Two 4GB sticks) 1080p 2715x1527 Resolution, which to my understanding is about the same as 4K If you want me to, I can post my Nvidia Control Panel stuff. And sorry about the title, just learned how to use flairs.I saw this happen last year, and it's happening again this year The beginning was slow. Either RW was scared about his ability to throw, or scared that his receivers wouldn't come down with the ball. We went through this last year, and once he got his confidence going, we started to move the chains more methodically. Another thing I feel that would make a big difference for our team, is the realization we can't play grinder football anymore. We were able to rely on that before because A)RW was a new/young QB and B) our D was consistently making huge plays. Unfortunantly, we're not that same team anymore. There needs to be variety, trick plays, and dare I say, aggressive offensive game plans. I am sure this all has been said to death, but I wanted to throw my two cents in.We probably weren't alone. Frequently for the past few nights, I've been sneaking out late with my friend who I'll refer to as J. We would bring some alcohol and travel to our old primary school (elementary school for the Americans). We would often sneak out at 1:30am or 2am and return home not too drunkenly at 4am-ish. Well, some hours ago from now. Our school has a very small forest next to it, which while it is small, it is kinda big as well (not ridiculously small). So, we're sitting at a bench, drinking alcohol and quietly whispering to each other. It was so eerily quiet and unsettling and that's when it happened. We turn to the forest and a few hundred birds from the front centre rush out the trees instantly. J and I turn to face each other in pure fear. What startled them? What disturbed them? They were the rhetorical questions we asked each other. J said he heard twigs snapping. We sobered up very quickly. In an attempt to try and be brave, I suggested we walk up to it or even go in it with our phone flashlights. So we walked up to it and remained still. More twig snaps and birds leaving promptly from a different side. We decided to run to a fence and vault it, quickly leaving. In hindsight, I do not know what had disturbed the birds so much. I know it was not us because we leave often. I do not reckon it was a homeless person because we go there often. Either way, we sobered up extremely quickly and didn't return. We will go there tomorrow and I'll update on if anything happens. We know about Coronavirus lockdown. Neither of us have symptoms or family members with symptons otherwise we would not leave. I guess we just struggle in our households.Looking for piece of art used in Project Diva 2nd Hi, long time Project Diva fan here! Recently I was watching a fan-made PV for a P-Model song made in Project Diva 2nd. In the music video there seems to be a piece of art in the background of one of the shots. Take a look: I've tried looking for this piece of art on the Project Diva Wiki but to no avail. The picture gallery section for PD2nd is completely empty, and I have no clue what the source is for these photos in HQ other than ripping them from the game itself or finding the artist on Piapro/Pixiv. So, I'm asking that someone could help me find this or at least knows where I can find the artist who drew this art? It's just so cool and I'd love to have an HQ version of it. Thank you! [Apologies this is such bad quality, it's literally from 2012 lol.](https://preview.redd.it/t5qgpejyt8891.png?width=2388&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dd5df25d0cba193150b60af6d7dbb283ff19b8f)I feel completely alone in my problems right now. I lost my pet of five years five days ago. I had just finished my last exam for finals when I got the call from my Mum. Completely out of the blue, the only silver lining was that she died peacefully in her sleep. At some stage I'm going to have to go home to cremate her, it will literally crush me to have to go back but I have to do it anyway. It really doesn't help that my aunt was diagnosed with a terminal illness this year either. So I've just been pushing down all of the anxiety and hoplessness for the past six months and it's all come up again. I was out with friends yesterday and I had this sudden realisation that no one around me really understood how much it hurt. Just felt so out of place with 5+ people all merry and having a great time when I was trying so hard not to completely break down. The only person who really 'got' it was my flatmate who had lost a pet in childhood, asked me if I was okay after I was screaming crying in the bathroom after it all hit me. It really comes in waves right now, I go by a day without crying and then the next day I'm in bed with the blinds drawn sobbing, with my parents so far away I have no one that close to me to confide in. Other problems seem 10x worse, dealing with acne right now, got made fun of on a subreddit and called stupid - I wish people would understand there's a human being behind the screen and not a punching bag. Just don't know why I have to deal with so much pain all at once... How long does it take to get over pet bereavement? Anyone else dealing with this right now?How Bad is Glasgow During the 12th? Hi there, I’m originally from Northern Ireland and I’m currently doing uni at Glasgow. I’ve decided to stay here and get a job over the summer since I love this place so much, but I’m a bit worried about what Glasgow is like during the 12th July/Orange Order celebrations… As far as I know Scotland has some Orange Walks that take place mainly during the summer months and some in September, and coming from Belfast I really do not want to be caught in the middle of one or even set my eyes on them. Side note, really glad everyone on this subreddit seems to fucking despise these cunts and call them the “shame of Scotland”. Refreshing as obviously where I’m from we have to tolerate these bigots even when they burn down and vandalise homes. How often do the walks take place in the centre of Glasgow and on what dates? I’m living in the West End and I go to the city centre often so whatever dates align with these areas please let me know. Do any major celebrations take place during the 12th in Glasgow or do they all fuck off to NI instead? Appreciate anyone’s advice on this, thanks!How to stop being annoyed with my flatmate? To keep things simple, my flatmate loves to be right. They've expressed in the past how much they love it, and it's a very vexing thing to deal with. They manage to get on my nerves a lot by how often they try to pass their opinion as fact. To better explain what I mean by this, I have two other flatmates I'm living with currently. I get along with them really well, coversation with them is fun and easy to do. If they express an opinion different to mine, I have no problem with that. If they want to have a deep philisophical conversation, great! With the other flatmate, however, I always hate it. Their tone is what always pisses me off. They have a specific way of saying their opinion that just sounds like \"I know this is just an opinion, but i'm so obsessed with being in the right about everything that I'm going to phrase this in a way that sounds like I'm stating a fact.\" It's gotten to a point where I am always so annoyed and pushed over the edge by the way they talk. i've expressed to friends and family in the past by how annoyed I am, and while they understand they always say \"Well, there will always be things about a person you won't like\" I know this, I have a messy flatmate but they're hilarious and friendly so I can deal with that. I have a friend who always wants to have a convo right in the middle of class when i'm trying to pay attention but I try to forget about that because they're loads of fun. This flatmate, however, I feel myself mentally bracing for whatever they're about to do or say, i always feel on edge that they'll engage me in some conversation that ends with them trying to make out that they know more than they do. I get so angry thinking about them, I wish we could just get along. I've decided (since, unfortunately, I've agreed to find a flat with them next year) to just take it on the chin and deal with it in a civil manner - how do I deal with this? What should I tell them when they sart to talk like this, how do I stop myself feeling so mentally on-edge when they come into the room?IIL shows where a character is always involved in awkward/unfortunate yet comedic scenarios, WEWIL? I am absolutely obsessed with the character of Yuuko from the anime Nichijou and how most of her scenes include her in situations where she does something stupid or embarrassing that’s relatable to the audience (ie. sitting on a bench and not realising it’s wet paint, struggling to order off a convoluted menu at a café or restaurant, thinking someone is talking to you when they're talking to someone else on the phone etc,)it’s extremely cathartic to watch. Watamote also but not necessarily centred around the woes of being an awkward kid in High School. What genre of comedy is this and are there any other schadenfreude-esque shows like this? EDIT: Doesn’t have to be an anime btw!! I’m up for anything be it movie, series or book that has this theme.IIL Film Soundtracks Like The Secret Of Kells and VGM like ICO, WEWIL? Ironic because I’m Irish but I don’t know where to start on finding music similar to tracks like Aisling’s Song (Pangur Ban) from The Secret of Kells and also the more atmospheric tracks like the opening theme to the film https://youtu.be/BNf39v4r0n0. Doesn’t need to be strictly Irish Folk but very atmospheric hence why I mentioned ICO, too (specifically the tracks You Were There and Castle in the Mist). Lots of guitar and miscellaneous woodwind and wind-chime-y instruments maybe? There’s also this song from the game Pop’n Music I love that matches the vibe too. -> https://youtu.be/H1g_R8HH4K8IIL experimental, bleak, surreal, hard-to-watch TV shows/Short Films like Jam (2000), WEWIL? I stumbled upon Jam looking through a list of shows Chris Morris (the guy behind On the Hour, Day Today, Brass Eye) worked on. It was unbelievably unsettling, but I'm itching for more stuff like it. Anything tailor-made to be difficult to sit through, experimental editing, surreal plot points, etc. I've seen My Wrongs #8245–8249 & 117 and loved it - so anything akin to that is good too. I know Jam is notorious for being unlike anything else on television, but it'd be fun to watch something else that'll give me the creeps for days after viewing.Help creating a JP iTunes account and getting past VPN problems? About a year ago I tried downloading Cinderella Girls on my iPhone, I was able to set up an account no problem, able to download the game but couldn't get past that screen in the every beginning which blocks your account if you don't have your VPN switched to Japan. I deleted the game out of laziness, now I want to play it properly this time. However I have a couple of problems. Firstly, when registering for a JP iTunes account it asks for mobile verification on top of email verification (the reason I'm registering for a new account is because my old account is linked to an email that I cannot get into anymore) I'm using a mock number of course, and when I decline this pop-up it cancels the next step in my registration - most tutorials on registering for an iTunes account do not mention this, so I have no idea how to register my new account in the first place. If anyone has any tips on how to register I would be very thankful, and where I can download a VPN tool on my phone to get past the location problem. I know these questions are a dime a dozen, but I would love to get into this game/franchise. Thank you![TOMT] [FLASH ANIMATION] [MID TO LATE 2000s] Pink-haired girl travels through different video game franchises to buy milk for her breakfast. Animation began with pink-haired girl wearing a white top, purple pants, and finger-less gloves mimicking the Sonic opening (the classic opening where Sonic appears through the giant ring and waves his index finger). It then cuts to the girl sitting down to enjoy breakfast, realizing she has no milk, then it cuts to a mock-level screen showcasing the varying worlds of game franchises she'll travel across to get to the corner store. The rest of the video is then a montage of the girl defeating enemies from these different worlds and switching art styles at some points to that of whatever video game world she was in. Eventually she reaches the corner store, asking the clerk for milk, to which the clerk, who I believe was also a video game character, says, \"That'll be twenty coinses(sic) please!\" the girl reaches for her wallet and then remembers she left it at home, banging her head on the clerk's table. Name was something like \"SUPER (pink-haired girls name) BROTHERS\" or something similar to that. I watched it at a very young age and have been looking for it for what feels like a decade.Looking for LOVE ROLLERCOASTER (2008) and other Anime Innovation Tokyo short films Since last year I've been looking for several short films released through a project by Anime Innovation Tokyo, which sponsored a group of Japanese animators' own films with the help of professionals in the industry. The most popular film to come out of this project was 'Cencoroll', which I'm sure many people have heard of. This project ran from around 2005 to 2010 - you can visit the now-defunct website here -> [https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014819if\\_/http://www.anime-innovation.jp/sys/news.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20110319014819if_/http://www.anime-innovation.jp/sys/news.php) I found out about these films from this YouTube channel, which I believe was linked to AIT as it has only uploaded the trailers for these films -> [https://www.youtube.com/user/DOGAKAKUMEI](https://www.youtube.com/user/DOGAKAKUMEI) One specific film I am looking for from this roster is titled LOVE ROLLERCOASTER, which was directed by video game designer Hiromasa Horie -> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz\\_lePsGZfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz_lePsGZfE) I have only been able to find listings for this film on Anime encyclopedia sites such as [MyAnimeList.net](https://MyAnimeList.net), there are a few other videos on YouTube of this film's production and alternative trailers, but that is all I have been able to find of it so far. The official AIT website states that on two occasions this film was aired as a TV special on educational Japanese TV Channels - I have no idea if this film was released commercially on DVD or was solely aired as a TV Special. Regardless, I am hoping that by posting this I can find some help digging out maybe a link or site that may have this film to stream or to buy - even other lost AIT Project films. &#x200B; https://preview.redd.it/0v34djeggjj51.png?width=355&format=png&auto=webp&s=e87b47705053e8073ad0777a2a91fd7e3d33002a https://preview.redd.it/9l7c8clfhjj51.png?width=237&format=png&auto=webp&s=52845b03ea5c9ee9a534e786fbda58072aa1be45Paranoia from the way I dress? This is really odd (at least I think it is), I need to know I’m not alone in this and if anyone can rationalise this odd bout of paranoia with me. Ever since I was about 11/12 I’ve been increasingly paranoid that my outward appearance (mainly the clothes I wear) is constantly being judged or assessed by others. What I mean by this is more than just, “I’m worried people think I look strange for the clothes I wear” - it’s more that I’m extremely worried that what I wear is telling people something about me that isn’t true. It’s difficult to put it in a simple sentence, but it’s like, if I wear something I worry that I’m accidentally dressing like how a famous celebrity, or character from a film or TV show does. I know that a lot of people will adopt the clothing habits of their favourite celebrity or “style icon” and whatnot, but for me I’m worried others think I’m dressing like some random celebrity as if I wanted to be them or I idolise them - most of the time I cannot even tell you who this celebrity or character from a film and TV is, my brain immediately resorts to “What if you’re dressing like (BLANK) person?”. It’s got to the point where I find myself so self conscious going out!! Anyone else deal with this? And can someone please help me on how to stop thinking this way? Thank you!![TOMT] [FLASH CARTOON SERIES] [EARLY 2000s] Insane rabbit-dog hybrid animal (sandy-cream colour) VERY dark and a little surreal at moments- something about 'popsicle' being the word of the day. Most likely from some old Newgrounds flash animation. Features an animal that looks mostly like a dog or rabbit. The premise of each episode(?) is that the animal is mentally not okay. Set up like some sort of kids show a la Peewee's Playhouse. One of the most memorable scenes is a 'Word of the Day' segment. The animal states 'popsicle' is the word of the day - the word is displayed from a book - and says directly to the viewer 'Now, when you hear this word, I want you to scream and shout as loud as you can!' the word is uttered at some point and the animal loses it, flailing about almost insanely while varying loud noises and images flash up on screen. Not entirely sure the whole 'Kid's Show' premise was a reoccurring theme of the flash cartoon. Another video included the animal lip-syncing to a song, I cannot remember it as well as the popsicle video but the animal seemed in anguish about something. The song was also quite dark in nature. The voice actor for the animal was most likely female, a young-ish sounding voice with an American accent.How to stop/limit Music being my Trigger? Let me start off by saying I'm brand new to this subreddit, so apologies if there's twenty other posts exactly like this one. I've been a Maladaptive Daydreamer for as long as I can remember, so much so that until yesterday I believed that the MD way of thinking was the 'normal way' of thinking. Music is by far the biggest trigger for my daydreams. I have a whole routine in the evenings where I'll sit in my room, lights off, and proceed to listen to hours of music and come up with silly fantasies or scenarios in my head. It's gotten to the point where listening to anything automatically sends me into a daydream. For example, if I listen to music while I draw/paint my attention becomes immediately diverted to my daydreams. I have tried to concentrate specifically on a song, recoginising instruments and the like, I found some progress in this technique of limiting my MD! However I still find it difficult - my biggest problem is that all this music I love is increasingly becoming boring or stale to me because I go into my daydream world where this music is simply background noise to me. I've read on a Mental Health forum that some individuals have cut music completely out of their lives to limit their daydreams - how far does this actually work? I'd rather not cut something so important to me out of my life! I'm sure that many people on this sub can relate to what I'm going through - can someone please give me some tips/pointers on how to limit the effect music has on my MD? Thank you!! TL;DR: Music is a huge trigger for me, so much so that it's affecting my concentration when I put it on for other activities/chores. Music I only just start listening to quickly becomes stale and boring. How do I limit MD's effects on my music?taking icon requests! hello all! i've had a recent hyperfixation with cutting out characters and making icons with them, but i'm running out of material of my own, so i'll be taking requests here! i'll also include a transparent png of the character(s) you request, and if you have a specific image or flag you want, you can either dm me or paste a link in the comments of this post. you can request as many times as you like, but i will be setting a limit of 3 characters/specific images per request for convenience. thank you!a question regarding tcg codes hello! i have a question regarding tcg codes, forgive me if this is silly or obvious but after reading the rules i'm still not quite 100% sure on whether it's okay or not, so can somebody please confirm that i'm allowed to dump tcg codes? i'm just a collector, so i have no use for them, but i've kept most of them because i'd feel bad to waste them even though i don't know anybody who plays tcg online. however i've gotten to a point where i'm getting pretty tired of keeping track of my stockpile, as i'm pretty sure i've lost a few (sorry!), so i was hoping to come here and dump my codes for anyone that wants them, and i wanted to make sure that's okay before i do. or maybe it'd be better for me to do a giveaway? i think the biggest thing holding me back from doing a giveaway though is that i have no idea what any of these codes even give anymore, so i'd hate to build up hype for a bad pull. input on this would also be greatly appreciated! thank you all, i hope you have a pleasant day. tl;dr: is it okay to dump my tcg online codes here, and if so, is it better to dump them all at once and have it be first come first serve or do a giveaway and select random winners, even if i don't know what the codes give?nzap 89 build/weapon recommendations needed! hi all! im an nzap 89 main (and i think im rather good with it) who just had a fall from grace so hard that it's making me rethink my weapons choice. ive also been struggling with a good 89 build because i dont think my current build is utilizing it properly, here is my build: head - tenacity, special power up, main power up, special charge up clothes - special power up, main power up, bomb def up dx, ink saver sub shoes - swim speed up, 2 main power up, special saver i love the nzap 89 dearly and it's just about all i ever play with anymore but victory steak after victory streak ive fallen on my face so fast that i think it might be time for me to expand my horizons. i should add that i almost always stick to turf war (im still not ready to face my biggest fear that is ranked mode) and am currently looking at some of the dualies, particularly the enperry and kensa dualies. the nzap makes me feel fast and powerful as opposed to using rollers so im thinking dualies would be my best shot in terms of substitution, im just not sure which one i should pick so i thought id ask people who have more experience with this sort of thing :) im not looking for a total replacement for the nzap 89! im just looking to expand my horizons a bit with some good dualies and a new build, thank you!I think the mob is after me I think the mob is after me I went out drinking with friends abour 6 months ago, I blacked out and wokeup the next day fully clothed on a buddys couch. I live in Rhode Island but this was in Jersey. I have never harmed anyone in anytime drinking but I started to get lost in the what ifs. Specifically what if I sexually assaulted someone and dont remember. I spoke to everyone I was with that night and they said I did nothing wrong at all. Fast forward to now, I started working at a Gym its been a month since I got out of a psych ward. I have had paranoia of the mob being after me for months since they have ties to the State of New Jersey. Yesterday, this truck slowly drove bye my job with tinted windows and jersey plates (in rhode island) at exactly 4:59 pm, which is right when they could expect I would be getting off shift. I usually go to the gym to workout late night and everytime I see a car at night I get scared that they may be in on the whole thing. I am bordering the point of no return, Ive started following these cars trying to see who is in them. I am not on antipsychotics because I refused them in the ward. One part of me knows these are just intrusive and delusional thoughts so im able to combat most of them. But this whole video of the truck thing, the jerseys plates, and the tintedwindows all seem to coincidental.

Anyone else? My old friend was extremely into Tinder, and he would always show me pictures of the girls he would match with asking what I think about them. And I never felt anything. No attraction or any kind of gutteral feeling. I could understand why someone would find them attractive, but that was as far as it went. My friend would get pissed when all I would do is shrug and say \"I don't know, I guess they look good\". It made me feel broken and faulty somehow. Now years later I realized that I develop attraction through a long and built up connection with someone. It sucks because I feel unfit for the grind that is online dating and dating apps. Does anyone else deal with this? I feel like I'm the only one.Where will Mr. Beast (and other ocean cleaners) put the trash they remove? I hear all the time about people cleaning their local beaches and making machines to efficiently clean debris and garbage from bodies of water, and now the big one has come around with Mr. Beast raising money to remove 3M lbs. of trash from the ocean. But my question is always, where does the trash go? Yeah, it's cool that the trash is out of the water, but what do you do with the trash after. Is it burned, recycled, put in a landfill or does it end up right back in the ocean? People seem to be focusing only on the removal part and not asking about how the trash is disposed of which is what always confuses me. Any insight would be awesome.I want to eat better, exercise and make it to 160. I am 5'11 and currently 215 lbs., the most I've ever weighed in my life. I've tried so many times to lose weight, but I always quit and gained the weight back. I want to feel better about myself and not feel disgusted every time I look in the mirror. I'm starting by trying to walk my dog, run for at least 10 minutes and doing basic calisthenics every day. But, I'm afraid these will quickly fall to the wayside as I'm easily discouraged and I have no one to keep me accountable. I'll try my best and I hope I can pull through. Wish me luck.I feel broken for how I feel. I've only just recently considered the possibility of me being demisexual, and the more I ponder it the more it seems likely. The thing is, I feel like such a dysfunctional human being for it. For example, I can't even fathom me ever having a one-night stand. The thought makes me so uncomfortable. I could only ever do that stuff with someone I've known for a long time and trust. But it seems like everyone else is having the time of their lives. Partying and having one night stands. Crushing the dating app game and having all kinds of sex with random people. Paying on the regular to bang sex workers. And I'm here so uncomfortable with it all. I feel like a broken human being. Like something in me is wired wrong. Does anyone else ever feel this way?My therapist dismissed my abuse and I'm afraid to talk about it again. I've seen 7 therapists in my life, only when I got to my 5th did I have the hindsight and courage to acknowledge the abuse my brother put me through. She was a great therapist and I liked her, which is why I opened up to her. But she asked how much older my brother was than me at the time, and I said about 3-4 years. She said it really only counts as abuse if the age gap between the victim and the abuser is 5+ years. It made me feel so confused and has made me question the abuse I've received from other family, and now I'm afraid to being it up again with my new therapist. I don't know what to do.Was able to convince a group of kids that I fought a bear with my scars. Funny little story. At my old job (as a worker at a laser tag center), I was given the nickname \"Sparkles\" by my boss as a joke. Our nicknames are displayed on our nametags. While briefing a group of people, some kids came up to me and asked me why my nickname was \"Sparkles\". I told them it was because I once fought a bear, and he exploded into sparkles. They didn't believe me, so in response I lifted up my left sleeve to reveal my ugly scars on my upper arm. A few of them started freaking out saying, \"Woah, he really did fight a bear!\" Still makes me chuckle to this day.I live in the house where I was abused. I feel so uncomfortable living here. Even though nothing has happened for years, I can't shake this anxious feeling I always get. I can't stop seeing it happen when I walk into the living room or my bedroom. I keep having nightmares of it happening again or dreams of being tortured and killed. I can't leave because I have no where else to go. Being here can be sort of nice sometimes, since my parents are kinder to me now than they were before. But it's mostly draining on me in every way.My hype is back I’ve been so exhausted seeing all the doom and gloom over Sw/Sh. I get it isn’t perfect, but for what it is, I’m perfectly content with it and want to see improvements for future games. I understand the criticisms, but... Holy crap, the fandom is disgusting right now. Constant arguments, not letting people enjoy things, starting a weird crusade against GameFreak... I’m just happy there’s a more chill subreddit here. My hype was going low, but now I found my people here. So here’s to Sword and Shield coming out soon!I might need a break from Death Battle This is probably more personal than it has to be so fair warning I guess lmao Now, don’t get me wrong. I love the show and some of the recent episodes have shown a ton of improvement over the early seasons. But the issue here is that I think my anxiety or stress is kind of hampering my enjoyment of the show. It’s hard to explain, but let me use an example. Say, Mario Vs. Sonic 2: Electric Boogaloo. They did the previews. I noticed Mario got way more info about his durability compared to Sonic. The music (without any context to the fight) sounded like it was more in Sonic’s favor. The preview has Mario in the advantage spot by the end, which at the time made me think Sonic was gonna pull through after being battered. I didn’t want to see Mario lose again, so I get anxious just waiting for the episode so I can rip the bandaid off. Then, Mario wins, and I feel relief. This basically is two weeks of stress about this episode, culminating with the episode actually coming out and either confirming my fears, or proving me wrong and I feel relief. Which is nice and all, but it’s getting to a point where I’m so anxious over what Tinfoil hat theory is gonna pop up; and it’s happened again with Crash Vs. Spyro, Johnny Cage Vs. Captain Falcon, and now it’s happening with Dragonzord Vs. MechaGodzilla. I know this is probably stupid to get stressed over. Ffs, these are fictional characters fighting in non canon fights with 50/50 research. I shouldn’t be taking it so seriously. But... I dunno. The anxiety on who will win is just too much sometimes. TL;DR: I might need to take a break from watching Death Battle. At the very least to the point where I can take things less seriously and just move on with stuff. It’s not like the result itself is what upsets me, it’s the wait to that result. It isn’t fun, I tell ya.Consumed by worry again. I’m about to fly out of state for a bit for a vacation thingie. For two and a half weeks, I’m gonna be out of the house, but I feel really worried. Not worried over leaving. I’ve done this before. But I’m worried about my folks. My mom, my grandma. I don’t know if they’ll be fine while I’m gone. Just a lot of worried thoughts are swarming at the moment. I don’t want anything bad to happen to them, and as far as I know, they’re both fine in terms of health. But I’ve been having an intense worrying sensation. I don’t know why. Just kinda need to relax for now I guess.I’m still getting Pokémon Sword all things considered “But there’s no national dex!” Eh. I liked making new teams. “But the graphics!” It’s one tree. The rest of the game looks perfectly fine. “You’re just a Gamefreak shill!” Eh. I just don’t care much for ranting over this kinda stuff. It has to be game-breakingly bad for me to look away. I never paid much attention to the National Dex, so while the lack of it sucks, I don’t think the game as a whole is suddenly “the worst game in the series”. Wait until it’s out. Then you can grab your pitchforks.I don’t want to lose anyone else Ever since we moved houses, I’ve been constantly worried and panicking over the little things. Whether it’s health anxiety, or the more concerning of the two, worrying over the well being of those around me. It doesn’t sound so bad, but now I’m freaking out over how life has been taking people I care for away at a consistent rate. 2017: Half-Sister passes away 2018: Bearded Dragon passed away 2019 has had me shaking and I’m legit praying every chance I get so that I don’t lose anyone else. My grandma (72) has leg pain from arthritis and I can’t afford to lose her yet. My mom (50) has been suffering through general stress and I don’t want that to catch up to her. I guess what I’m saying is I’m so constantly paranoid about losing someone else in my life. I need help. I need something to relax my fears badly.I have to let this out It wasn’t too long since I posted, but my anxiety came back with a vengeance. I keep feeling like I see weird light streaks and floaters and I don’t know if that points to a brain tumor. There’s been dreams I’ve had at this point about me having a potential terminal illness which is driving me to insanity. I know the thing with Brain Tumors is that they’re less than 1%, but I don’t know when or if I should worry. I went to the doctor a month ago and they said I was fine, so... I dunno. Something’s up with me, and I don’t know if it’s anxiety or something to genuinely worry aboutBrain Tumor Concerns I’ve been feeling super anxious lately and thought it would be worth venting out at the moment. I’m M/20 years old, and I’ve been feeling anxious over the idea of a brain tumor. - Headaches have been present-ish, but they’ve been minor. I wouldn’t call them the worst headaches in my life. - I feel like I’ve been seeing tiny streaks of light? It’s not huge glares, or anything that has messed up my vision, but I feel like I see tiny streaks sometimes. - I sometimes feel like I have double vision when reading? But that might be just a me problem since I need glasses. - Left eyelid has a small twitch. Though the right eyelid has been starting a bit too. - Been waking up earlier than normal. - Not sure if my speech always had me stuttering. Might be overthinking it. - My ears have been ringing for a while now. - I haven’t vomited, or suffered any seizures yet. I dunno if I can chalk this up to allergies, since they hit hard this season. I just need comfort that this isn’t a reason to panic. This anxiety has been really messing me up, and even if I’m going to the doctor in two weeks, I’m a bit concerned for my health.What's the general consensus on Pokémon Mystery Dungeon's power levels? First off, Spoilers for the Mystery Dungeon games. I've been playing Explorers of Sky and Super Mystery Dungeon lately, since they're some of my favorite games of all time. But I remember hearing at some point that the PMD protagonist is basically universe tier? At least for Super. I know applying Emera gives them a hell of a lot of buffs, and there are a couple feats I can think of that show their strength. (Falling from a borderline atmospheric height, being able to take on Dark Matter without evolutions, etc.) Just wanted to verify with you guys since I'm still learning the whole versus debate deal. How strong are the PMD cast?I'm scared These past two years have been honestly rough. It hasn't bothered me too much, but the dark thoughts are spiraling out of control now and I need to get it out of my head. 2017. My sister died. We went to her funeral and it was the first time I've ever had to go to one. It destroyed me to watch someone with so much liveliness in a casket and the people I love, who I saw so cheery and upbeat before any of this happened, to be in a distraught and inconsolable mindset. 2018. My Bearded Dragon who I held so close to my heart passed away. We had to bury the little guy. I'm still reeling since that was just a month ago. I want to get another but I don't want to feel like I'm replacing my little buddy. Hell, I'm not even confident if I can raise another after all that's happened. I think I'm developing a fear of death. My own included, sure. But I'm scared of losing anyone else in my life. My girlfriend, my best friends, my family. I'm not ready to lose anyone else. But the sad thing is, there's nothing I can do to control this. Death is always creeping around the corner. I'm just scared on what's going to happen next. I'm not ready to lose anyone else in my life. I'm just afraid of whatever comes next at this pointGyarados Vs. Lagiacrus R1: Wild Fight (Base stats and moves for Gyarados Vs. MH3U/MHX Lagiacrus) R2: Trainers (Gyarados + Pokémon Trainer/Mega Evolution Vs. Lagiacrus + Rider/Kinship attacks) Both fights take place out in the open shores. Rider is not in access of any complex armor. Just with what's given at the start of the game. Trainers have access to healing items Thoughts: Gyarados, applying Pokedex entry stuff, is a city level threat to my knowledge. Especially during a full rampage. Lagiacrus, physically at least, I don't think matches, but has elemental advantages with access to electricity, which can land x4 damage due to Gyarados' Water/Flying typing. It's really a case of who can their hit first, so I'm kind of abstaining here. Round 2? That's a different beast entirely. Stories!Lagiacrus is only a juvenile and yet can clash heads and push back against fully grown Diablos and Frenzy induced Deviljho. While Gyarados will still pose a threat, it doesn't lose it's lightning weakness, which I argue is going to be even worse here considering how massive Lagi's Kinship is. Consensus? Gyarados likely has the edge on round 1 while Stories!Lagiacrus has more than enough to put up a fight, if not win, in round 2.I actually WANT to see more Cinematic Universes There's so much potential to be done with a connected universe type series. Marvel, DC, the Monsterverse, Dark Universe, I like the idea of them... well. Some of them need work, obviously. Marvel and the Monsterverse are fine at the moment, DC started rough but looks like they're shaping up, also lol Dark Universe. I just think people need to look at a cinematic universe as less of a money making tool and more of a storytelling tool. That's why the Dark Universe already crashed and why the DCEU started rough, they were trying too hard to play catch up. If done right, you could easily have a competitor to the MCU. Trust me, I get that not everything has to be part of a connected universe. I'd just love to see how an actual well done universe can be pulled off down the line.Batman is the lamest superhero You know I feel this account has had roughly three to four seperate times mentioning my opinion on ol' Bats. Well. Might as well state the unpopular. Everyone and their mother always says \"Batman's the best hero\", \"Batman's better than Superman\", \"Batman's better than Iron Man\", etc etc. I'm gonna be direct right about now. Batman is dumb as hell. Better than Superman? I get everyone says the whole \"but Superman is a Mary Sue. Unlike Batman.\" Bro, Batman can be just as much of a Mary Sue if not worse. The guy with just some prep time can fight Superman and win. He's helping the entire Justice League fight these multiversal threats. He's not just this down to earth hero, he's already gone beyond. Plus, isn't it nice how every single Batman Vs. Superman conflict has Batman, the not-Mary-Sue-at-all, beat Superman? BvS, Injustice, etc? Can't we see a fight between the two where Superman's in the right and has to overcome this guy who's prepared with everything to take him down, so that he's still seen as this underdog in the fight? No? Just Batman using weaponized Kryptonite oxygen to beat him for the fifth time? 'K. Better than Iron Man? Look, at least Iron Man does the rich superhero thing better. The personality is way more fun to watch, compared to \"Brooding and not trusting the world\", he actually uses his riches to make suits that seem fit to take on high tier threats. It's just way more entertaining to watch tbh. There are good examples of Batman, don't get me wrong. I think the Animated series did fine with Bruce and kept him fairly likeable and down to earth in a good way. But the Batman that everyone wants to see is the one who can defeat the entire universe with just a day's worth of prep. I don't know man. I'm getting sick of seeing Batman as the no.1 hero every single time. If you like him, that's fine and dandy. We all got our opinions and it's okay. I just think Batman could use a ton of restructuring.I need therapy Tonight had sudden depression and anxiety hit like a freight train. I'm hearing my bratty cousin yell like a howler monkey in one room. I feel this weird pain on my right shoulder and my hypochondriac ass thinks it's a heart attack. My gf lost interest in a little activity we do. I don't blame her interests but she just kept being unsubtle about it and how dull her responses get. I'm afraid my friends home in Jersey are going to move on and forget about me I'm afraid I'm being a shitty owner to my Bearded Dragon. I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing as a pet owner. If I'm just making his life worse than if he were in the wild. I'm afraid I'm disappointing my parents because I'm not even in my next college semester, I don't know how to drive, and I have no job to help out in the house. I'm getting irrationally mad at my gf who's trying to console me but I keep lashing out because the help she's giving me is just repeating how everything will be ok. I don't even know anymore. Will it? Will I wake up to peace and quiet? I don't know She got frustrated and asked \"What do you WANT me to tell you?\" ... I have no idea anymore. I'm just a mess. I need therapy. I need a vacation. I need to run away from home. I just need SOMETHING to make life good again. I HATE this anxiety. I want it gone. I don't want to fear a little shoulder pain. I don't want to feel dread over waking up. But everything is just piling up today and I can't handle itI hate things here I was going to use a throwaway account but tbh no one else I know uses Reddit so what's the worry for? Anyways. I'm really starting to hate how life is for me here. My Grandma has yet again been the source of my anger. This isn't the first time since she spoils my cousin, but here she goes again, making me feel useless. She tells me I don't do anything in the house. I do the vacuum, take care of our pet, make my bed, help her do her morning walks outside. But I do nothing, right? Because I'm not in college right now, or because I don't work, I'm just a trash heap to her. Meanwhile my other cousin, who's gonna be a nurse, is just absolutely perfect to her. She does no wrong. She's usually sleeping in her room but hey, that's ok because she goes to work. I'm useless compared to her! She can do anything! I don't even dislike my older cousin. She's sweet and helpful when we need her to lend a hand. But my Grandma just fucking spoils her. Then there's me. The grandson who hasn't gone to school (I took a semester and am currently waiting to take the second semester) and who doesn't go to work. The only reason I don't go to work is because I can't drive yet. You know why? Because we moved from home and are now basically isolated in Florida. I could take my time back home because I had all the time to practice. But now it's like EVERYONE wants me to drive, to work. All that. I hate it. All this started just because I was tired from today's walk and didn't want to make my bed today. She just decided to tell me how much I suck at life. As if I didn't know. But SHE was the one who wanted us to move. SHE was the one who put me in this shithole. At least back home I could have walked to work or taken driving classes earlier. TL;DR - Hate Florida. Grandma reminds me on how much I suck at life even though she's the one who forced us down here. I want to run away from home and never look back.Dissector Front and Ardent Rear Has anyone tried this combo before? I ride the Dissector 2.4 upfront on a short travel rig and love it. I have Rekon 2.4 out back which is fast but I’m looking for something with a little more grip. //Update// Thanks everyone for all your comments! It helped big time. I wasn’t considering an Aggressor out back but there is so much love for that tire that I would like to give it a try with a Dissector out front. Happy ridding for those who can ride right now and as for the rest of us, the season is about to start really soon. 😀Growing Pains or Bad Career Move I just recently dove head first into a Digital Marketing role and feeling that I may have made a mistake. I worked as a web designer/graphic designer for a decade prior and afterwards spent the next seven years as a pixel jockey for digital platforms. Majority of my pixel jockey days have been with comms teams and a couple of years in content marketing. In retrospect, I realized that I preferred and sometimes enjoyed marketing over comms. Probably because it was just closer to what I did previously from a creative prospective. Now I’m at demanding job, head first in the Digital Marketing role and wondering if it was a mistake or am I only going through growing pains of working in a new field. I feel like I should be obsessed with the field and try to know everything I can, but I find myself feeling like a fraud and learning things I have to learn and taking my time doing so. There are times that I feel excited to be in this role but the struggles are real and taking away from the enjoyment. I am grateful for the opportunity and grateful to have job, especially now. Has anyone else gone through a similar situation?Zoom culture is increasing my paranoia When times get tough and my world narrows, I know it’s time to fight back. I negotiate a new start with myself and convince myself into a routine of yoga, mediation, and exercise. Along the way, I’m constantly searching for ways to help myself get through the struggle I have with my perception of what people are thinking of me. Especially the work life. Navigating through the minefield of paranoia has always been a struggle but I have always found a way back to a place where I forget that paranoia has a strangle hold of my happiness. Then, not before long, the cycle starts all over and I’m once again at it’s mercy. My self perception and paranoia are happy to see each other to pick up where they have left off. This time around, it’s different with the pandemic and how the entire world has made a massive mental shift. Having everything and everyone under a microscope seems to have become the new black and who knows what the short -long term effects will be on our psyche. It has become extremely difficult to let go of paranoia. I’m always asking myself if it’s because of the state the entire world is in right now and will I eventually find my way back to my old relationship with paranoia. We are all stuck in loop of suffering, changing, reflecting, and coping. So this must be temporary right? There are ways to interpret how the new worlds’ “found-self” has changed the relationship/worship with paranoia. I would love to hear what you think. Has your paranoia changed its face? What are you doing to cope? Do you think everyone’s emotional IQ shifted? Have you found a way to use your paranoia for good?Psychological horror set in a highschool where a girl kills people and shrinks their heads Might've been a French book, as I read it in French, but could've also been translated. Basically, There's this teen girl- she's the main antagonist of the book. I believe she's quite popular. She begins to hang out with our protagonist (let's call her P), and the antagonist (let's calls her A) suddenly learns how to ice skate, even though she couldn't before. P asks how she got those skills and A shows her the shrunken head of one of the best skaters in the school. Eventually, A kills P's best friend (?) and P gains her best friend's long and pretty nails. She find her best friend's body, headless in the park and realizes A killed her. P and A fight, leading to A trying to kill P, but P manages to take the voodoo doll from A and kill her instead. A begins bleeding through every hole in her face before dying, where P keeps her head and gains all her traits. TLDR: murderous girl gains people's traits by shrinking their headsYou don't deserve your guitar EP: entitled parent, F: friend, me: me (obviously) So when I was in elementary school, maybe 5th or 6th grade, I had this friend who I would hang out with often because she lived right next to my house. Her family wasn't very well-off, wouldn't pay rent, smoked, drank alcohol, ect. At that age, it was really hard for me to say \"no\" to people, especially her since I felt bad for F. Most of the time F would come to my house, but this time she invited me to her house so we could play our instruments together. She had this plastic guitar thing (It was basically shaped as an electric guitar, except it was buttons instead of strings) and she had told me to bring my real guitar. We start playing together, pretending we were in a band when EP walks in and says that my guitar was very nice. I thanked him and then he asks where I got it. I told him my mom's friend gave it to me when I was about 7 and he says something around the lines of \"You have alot more money than us, and F really likes to play guitar. I think she deserves it more than you.\" I was really taken back by that, because sure, our family were better off than them but we were nothing close to rich. I then said something like \"Well, I understand but this guitar means alot to me.\". He then proceeds to TAKE the guitar and that's when F snaps and tells him to give it back. She managed to get the guitar out of EP's hands and gave it back to me, needless to say I never went back to her house. Her parents, especially her dad were really scary. And did I mention their house smelled like cigarettes 24/7?Feeling of someone behind me. I constantly get the feeling that someone is behind me, not in a neutral way, but with a motive of harm. I imagine them standing behind me with a knife. I am scared of the dark because of this. Whenever I sleep, I can't sleep facing the wall due to this feeling. Its a sense of doom and I can feel them/it and it's terrible. It worsens when I have panic attacks, causing me to frantically look around and forces me to back into a corner to rid this. This is a very simplified way of my feeling, as I am very bad at explaining the way I feel. If anyone else has this please reply I just want this to stop. I am young and also have several symptoms of OCD (not that bullshit perfectionist stuff, but actual OCD)Depression can be hard: to myself. Depression can be hard. It kills, it takes away part of your life. Sometimes the depression is just inside your head. I promise it doesn't last forever, and the proof is in the past where you had euphoric, to even just mildly happy moods. Depression can be in your head sometimes (obviously), and when meds and other defenses don't work, it solely relies upon your outlook on the situation and the way your feeling. Sometimes by sheer force you can put yourself in a happier mood. And when you can't, being aware to the tidbit of others emotions, ex: making them happy, being genuine and just giving others encouragement, can bring you happiness. Honestly I have no clue what im saying, I'm writing this to myself in words that I will understand as I am in a nearly euphoric mood right now. Hopefully if this is coherent towards you, it might help. Just make people happy when you aren't. When your sad and deppressed don't let it control you, take control of yourself and your thoughts, and place your mindset to move foward and enjoy life. And most importantly; don't let people anger you when thats their goal.My beautiful baby I stood there, with my mind as open as my heart. I looked down at my body, blood pouring down scars and wounds closed with stitches done by myself. Pain was only a minor setback; even if it wasn’t, how could I stop loving my own child? When I first birthed my beautiful baby, he was born with no complications. The pure happiness that I experienced made me instantly attached, what kind of mother wouldn’t be? His first two months was perfect, he ate, he slept, and he brought me more joy than anything else in the world. But once he turned seven months old, everything went downhill. I remember it perfectly, he completely stopped eating for two days. I was absorbed with worry. I spent a few hours researching causes, but to no avail. I told myself if he didn’t eat the next day I would bring him to the doctor, and then I went to sleep. That night I was awoken by my son, crying, which was very abnormal. He usually sleeps perfectly throughout the whole night. I went to his crib (which was next to my bed) and instinctively picked him up and started singing a lullaby. “Rock a by baby…” I sang, gently rocking him and starting into his gorgeous green eyes. “In the tree top…” I continued, he widened his eyes and stared at my arm. I smiled at his seemingly joyful look. “When the wind blows…” He sharply moved his head into my arm and started biting. I knew I couldn’t drop him, or risk hurting him so I held him closer as blood started pouring down my arm. I pulled him closer as my flesh began to depart from my arm. I pulled him even closer as he began to chew on my arm, unreal strength tearing my skin and nearly reaching my bone. I finally pushed him away when he stopped biting and completely ripped the chunk of my flesh off my arm. I threw him down into his crib, blood all over my beautiful baby’s face as he continued to eat my arm. I finally realized why he wouldn’t eat. My baby doesn’t like milk, nor does my baby like any normal food for that matter. But that was the first feeding, after the 11th I realized that he would starve if I didn’t feet my precious baby, my entire world. I looked up from my body and started to rinse off the fresh hole in my arm. Pain was only a minor setback, my love for my baby is far greater than any physical pain that I could bear. I grabbed the sewing needle and string and started to sew my arm closed. I no longer winced at the pain, I embraced it, I enjoyed it, and I love it.250,0000 breathes [The 250,000 Contest] The creature breathed. It was hidden from my view, but I knew it was there. I could hear it and smell it. With each breathe it took a smell of rot escaped its body. I’ve never seen the monster before, but I can only imagine how terrifying it must look. 250,000 breathes. With each breathe it took my bed would slowly lift, I would be fueled by the sheer terror this creature caused me. I could never sleep, I would always be alert of when the creature would attack. Some may say that the creature is friendly, you must think, even to the slightest degree that this creature is protecting me. Protectors don’t kill the innocent. I can’t sleep, I can hear it. It watches me, it terrifies me, it's going to drive me insane to the point of my own demise. I’m sure you can hear it too, you may not feel it, nor its presence but I promise you can hear it. It starts off subtle, you may think the house is just creaking, or that it's just someone from another room breathing. If you can hear it, you have a reason to be afraid. It's going to kill you, and enjoy every second of terror it causes you. I’ve been counting, and it just reached its 249,999th breathe, I only have a few seconds left. The creature is trying to escape from underneath my bed. It’s coming to get me. It just took its 250,000th breathe. I’m scared. I was never ready for death, of course, I was curious about the afterlife, but if creatures like this exist then I don’t want to experience death. I don’t want to die.Never do drugs. It's hard doing the same thing every day, no one prepared me for the boredom that would follow adulthood. My name is Tyler, I work at a dollar general in a small town, and I already know I probably won’t go anywhere, but I still have a spark of motivation that will soon be lit. I want to provide, be someone that can raise a family, someone that my girlfriend, of two years, can rely on and financially trust. That’s why I started a small business. Working at dollar general I can obviously barely scrape in enough to live, 8$ an hour doesn’t go very far. Being frugal doesn’t provide a very lenient life, nor a happy one. After my hours at dollar general, I go home and start working on my business. I re-sell clearance items on Amazon, and sometimes eBay. It makes me a decent amount, and hopefully, as I start to sell more I can hire workers to help. As of now, it nearly consumes all my free time and gives a tiny amount of money in return. I’m only 23 and I know I have so much time left, but I feel like I’m not gonna go anywhere. The occasional depression periods don’t allow me to keep motivation very long. That’s all I want, motivation, a reason to keep pushing. Many people can say that being able to support a family should be motivation enough, but sadly, for me, it isn’t. As of now, it's nearing the payday and we won’t make it this month. There’s just not enough money, so meals will have to be skipped. I know Sarah, my girlfriend will take this news badly. I know she will sit, and cry and wish she chose someone better than me. I’m useless, I just want to get past this rough patch, but my thoughts keep telling me this isn’t just a rough patch, this is my life. I open the doors of dollar general and hear the obnoxious ring of the door. I walk towards the worker's lounge and take a seat inside. The walls are a pale yellow, but other than the few paintings on the wall the lounge is just like all others. Jake, my drug addicted co-worker is searching through the fridge for food. His obvious high is annoying, I wish I could be as happy as him, even if it was because of some drugs. “Jake, come here for a minute,” I said, I wanted to confront him. Jake slowly turned towards me, I couldn’t tell if it was sarcastic, or if he genuinely couldn’t help it. “Sup tyler. What do you need man” “I just want an escape man, you know I’m not the type of person to ask for stuff and honestly, I don’t know how to ask for this. I’m in a void right now, life has just got me down, and I really don’t have anything to live for, but I can't give up.” I said, nervously fidgeting with my fingers. “Drugs man?” he laughed, it made me uncomfortable, even more than I already was. “Ya know I ain’t got none to spare but I can hook you up with a dealer or too” “Y..Yeah that would be great” Jake jotted a name and phone number down on a index card and handed it to me. “That was easy” I thought to myself, it really was so easy. I rushed through work in anticipation, waiting to make the phone call that would end my worries. It was a boring day overall, but I pushed through it. I constantly watched the clock waiting for 6:00. I rushed out the doors, attempting to conceal my excitement in all ways possible. I always looked down on drug users, and I began to beat myself up for being so excited. But of course, I didn’t let those intrusive thoughts truly hurt me. I took out my phone and dialed the numbers. I was met with silence. “Hey, uh, my nam-” I was interrupted by a deep intimidating voice. “How did you get my phone number?” “Um, uh, Jake gave it to me.” I’m an idiot, I didn’t know how to talk to a drug dealer, I couldn’t even talk to a normal, average person. “Oh, ok what do you need man” It surprised me how much he opened up once I said Jake’s name, he must really trust him. “Just an escape, life’s been tough. I-” the man interrupted me once again. Why was he so eager to finish? “I have what you need. I’ll give you some, free of charge to give you a taste. You will love it.” I trusted him, I trusted him way more than I should have. He proceeded to give me a meeting place, it was fairly close by my house. The thoughts at the back of my mind lingered; I shouldn’t get involved in any drugs, I shouldn’t ever even touch them. Something bad is going to happen. I met him behind a waffle house. It wasn’t the most seclusive place, but it make me more comfortable. The man wore a simple outfit; a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt. “Here man” he said, as he held a bag of green powder in front of me “free of charge, just let me know if you like it, I have plenty more”. I crept my hand toward the bag and grabbed it. I felt like an idiot, but I reluctantly asked, “How do I take this?”. “Snorting it is the easiest way. I gotta place to be, got anymore questions?” I nodded my head no, and he got in his truck and drove away. I got in my car and placed my finger in the bag. I’ve never snorted any drugs before, so it was a completely new experience. I reached my finger in the bag, and scooped a decent amount of the powder on to my finger. I put it up to my nose, and snorted the drug. It didn’t sting, nor hurt as I thought it would. I continued and did the rest that was in the bag. I expected immediate effects, but after 15 minutes waiting I didn’t feel anything. I decided to drive home (as it was only 10 minutes away). Except the occasional red light, and the anger that followed nothing happened during the ride home. Right as I pulled into my driveway I got an amazing feeling. My mood suddenly brightened and I just felt better than I’ve ever felt. I was cozy, it felt like a warm blanket was comforting me through the toughest time of my life. All the stresses that were previously on my mind were gone. Why couldn’t we feel like this forever? I sat in the car, enjoying this time of enlightenment to myself. “I need more” I said to myself, after only 5 minutes, the best 5 minutes of my life the effects were wearing off. “ I need more” I said, this time aloud. In the back of my mind I understood saying this wouldn’t do anything, but I needed more. “I need more”, this time I yelled as loud as I could. My body started itching, I needed more of whatever I took. My car started phasing, the world was going to eat me if I didn’t get more. The world was upset at me, I displeased them by my mere existence. They were watching me, the people. I couldn’t see them but I knew they were there. They had a plan to get me, and the only way I would be invulnerable to them is if I had more. I called the man back. “I need more” I croaked, I could feel the taste of blood crawling down my throat. “Ill be there” the man replied, then promptly hung up the phone. I understood him, he would bring me more. Within minutes, (or what felt like minutes) he was here. He held the bag in front of me, but pulled it back as I reached for it. “This time it comes at a price.” “I don’t care, I just need it!” I yelled at him, anger circulated through my boiling blood. “I have business, if you need more that bad you must kill her” “Kill who?” “Sarah.” I couldn’t kill my girlfriend. Although she was so close, but so were the drugs. Both so close nearly out of reach. I had to do it, think of me as a monster but if you do than you must not realize my situation. He handed me a knife, and I once again reached for the bag but he pulled it back. “Kill her first.” I put the knife in my pocket and stepped out of the car. Our apartment door stood a few yards in front of me. I walked towards the door, fully prepared for what I was about to do. I opened the door, and was greeted by a voice. “Tyler? Why are you home so late?” I ignored her and walked towards her with a smile. She put her arms out, expecting a hug. I gave her a hug, and held on tightly. I started crying, I didn’t understand why. Her life was no where near as great as mine, these drugs are my life now. She could never compete, no matter how hard she tried. I pulled the knife out of my back pocket and stabbed her neck. A look of terror stole her face, I stabbed her again begging for that look of helplessness to go away. But it didn’t. I left her there, of course I felt bad. What kind of monster wouldn’t feel bad at murdering an innocent girl who loved them? I walked out the door and got a look of acceptance from the man. He knew what he made me do, and he looked proud. He handed me the bag and I immediately went and did the drug. “Now, I have someone else for you to kill.” I looked at him with a look of shock, but he was serious. I knew I couldn’t go without this drug, forever I will have to leech off of him. I’m his pawn, his murdering pawn that will kill for a taste of a drug.I'm not crazy, I love you. She was heartbroken; but I knew that for an extended period of time, perhaps, in some eyes too long. I knew I should get up and comfort her, the tears in her eyes always made my heart melt. I loved her, and her sadness hurt me. It hurt me more than she could ever know and more than I could possibly ever show. I’m not crazy, I didn’t bound her to the chair, tie her hands with a rope, and muffle her mouth to be cruel. Those were just the precautions that I have to take for my love to work out. It's crazy how love can work out. Sometimes our mind is cruel; our rage overcomes us and we allow our self to hurt the one we love the most. If I told her my feelings, she would never believe me, not even if I get on my knees to beg for approval. She will always hate me, whenever I met her I knew her life was over. Some say I’m crazy, but I say I just go overboard sometimes. It hurts me that you won't eat, do you really want to die? Am I such a truly fucked up person that you hate me the way you do? I’m never enough, I wish you could feel how I feel. Ever since I took you, you threw me into a void of self-hatred, into a cycle of never-ending pity for myself. But don’t worry, I pity you too. You will feel my pain, as I slowly cut you until you bleed, as you attempt to cry out for a savior that will never come. I'll kill you, then kill myself and we shall be together forever, bound to hell with each other.I don't want to be alive anymore I had a normal upbringing. I was never abused, I never saw my family members during coitus, I never had problems until I had to join the workforce. I have \"dumb kid\" written on my forehead. I am known far and wide for being a shit head. My whole neighborhood thinks I'm slow witted. The few places I do go like work, people have the assumption that I am the scapegoat, the novel concept that someone is worse at life than they are. I just want to be treated like a person. I just want to live in anonymity until I mercifully pass away. I used to be bad into drugs. Every night I am terrified that someone from that drug circle is going to kick my door in and kill us. Every single night. I talk to my wife about it, but I don't want to be a burden to her anymore. I can't escape These problems, I can only be myself. I can't move to a different location, I can't afford it and even if I did, people would have a field day with me in the new location. I have constant drug hunger. I come home from work every day and watch drug porn like Drugs INC and Intervention. I can't take it anymore. I was smoking weed to dull my mind to not think about my situation but I don't want to do that anymore. I may need to go on antidepressants as a last resort in order to cope. I don't want to take SSRI's. I've been on them before and I don't like the side effects. I try and stay clean and even get exercise and still the depression latches onto me with a vengeance. I don't know what to do. If I had a handgun I would have been dead YEARS ago. Seriously, what do I do?Scared Shitless This is unrelated but The other day I posted something on my local city's reddit page showing genuine concern for my community. The local redditors tore me a new asshole, citing past things I had posted on reddit that were bad. They threw the bad stuff I posted in the past in my face. I didn't even know people could see past shit you post on this site. If I had known that I never would have posted anything at all. Would they share that information to their little friends? Like, inbox message their friends copy and pasted text from my previous posts? Do you know what I'm saying? I logged out of that account, can they still snoop through all the previous stuff I posted, thinking the information was private? My second and much more serious issue is, I used to know some unsavory characters that are young knuckleheads with guns that can find out where I live. I cant afford to move. I don't know what to do. I feel like It's coming, Idk when. Every single day I'm on edge that they will come kick the door in. I don't have a gun. Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? I know they have guns, they're super, super shady and do weird stuff to hide their identities. Idk what to do. Am I overreacting or not?Getting an FFL in Pennsylvania. Im hoping someone has gon through this process and can shed some light on the situation. I want to get my ffl in pa and i know about the process with the atf it seems simple but what i need before i apply is what im curious about. I saw on the internet that i need to have a business name registered and get a tax id number from the irs even before i apply for the ffl license. Im usure if this is true while it does make sense and any information on that would be welcome. Also i dont wanna jump in head first and buy a building dedicated to gun sales i would rather start home based first and see ehat happens. If i do get the license and decide to operate at home is there anything special i would have to do zoning wise, insurance wise or have a different adress for business being that my house is first and formost residential?איך אתם מרגישים לגבי חוק איכות (נא לקרוא לפני ההצבעה) כבר הרבה זמן שהמודים לא יודעים מה לעשות עם האיכות של המימז בסאב. לתקופה מסויימת היה חוק איכות אבל חלקים מהקהילה התלוננה. אי אפשר להתעלם מהעובדה שככל שאנשים נכנסים לסאב ככה האיכות של המימז יורדת (אנשים לא מבינים את הקונספט, יותר אנשים רואים קהל לשיטפוסטינג בשביל קרמה וכו) אבל אנחנו לא רצינו להתעלם מהחלק של הקהילה שאמר שהוא לא אוהב את החוק ובסופו של דבר הורדנו אותו. כמובן שגם מאז האיכות של המימז המשיכה לרדת ואין לנו מושג מה לעשות נגד זה חוץ מחוק איכות. הרעיון הכללי (כרגע) הוא שאנחנו נוריד פוסט שאנחנו רואים שהוא לא מצחיק בכלל או לא מתאים לסאב וניתן לאנשים בדיסקורד לקבוע האם המימ מצחיק במידה ואנחנו לא בטוחים בעצמנו. אם המימ שלכם ירד ואתם חושבים שלא בצדק כמובן מוזמנים לערער. במידה והחוק יועבר אנחנו נדון בינינו וגם איתכם באיך החוק יעבוד בשביל שהחוק יהיה מקובל על כולם, אבל באופן כללי, איך אתם מרגישים לגבי חוק איכות? קחו בחשבון שהפוסט הזה הוא יותר לגבי לראות איך הקהילה מגיבה ופחות לגבי הצבעות בודדות.

Milestone הבא אני אכין עוגת טונהפארק לכבוד האירוע אבל זהו אין יותר לעשות חגיגה כל 10 נרשמים עכשיו אנחנו נהיים גדולים יותר צריך יותר מרווחים אז בקיצור אני מאחל לנו המון אושר וכושר ויושר ועוגות ודובים ושירים של טונהפארק ומזל טוב לכל מי שיש לו יומהולדת ואנחנו אוהבים אותכם ואותכן כי זוהי האחדות של מעריצי טונההבאן על טונה נגמר ויוחלף בחוק איכות הבאן על טונה נגמר באופן רשמי ויוחלף בחוק איכות. מהתפוקה של הסאב אני לא חושב שלרובכם תהיה בעיה לעמוד בחוק בבר שאנחנו רוצים להציב אבל פשוט תחשבו דקה כמה מקורי ומצחיק מה שאתם עומדים להעלות שווה את זה. פשוט אותם הדברים שהייתם רוצים לראות בסאב. בלי יותר מדי בדיחות טונה, דברים Low effort, שיטפוסטינג ממש חזק. עדיין ניתן להעלות גם דברים כמו דיונים, שאלות, דברים מקוריים ובערך כל דבר שקשור למוזיקה ישראלית. חוק האיכות לא יחול על פוסטים מהסוג הזה וגורלם יקבע על ידי האנשים בסאב. אני כלכך בודד והקולות פשוט לא יפסיקו אני מתחנן מהם ועושה כל מה שהם מבקשים ממני אבל הם פשוט אף פעם לא מסופקים אני עשיתי הכל הכל אבל הם בתוך הראש שלי הם פשוט לא מפסיקים אני בוכה וצורח והם פשוט לא יפסיקוהדוד אריה. כדי להיות הוגן, אתה צריך להיות בעל מנת משכל גבוהה מאוד על מנת להבין את ספרי דוד אריה. ההומור עדין ביותר, וללא הבנה מוצקה של הציונות השזורה בתרבות הישראלית, רוב הבדיחות יעברו מעל ראשו של הקורא הטיפוסי. יש גם השקפתו הניהיליסטית של אריה, השזורה בזריזות האופי שלו - הפילוסופיה האישית שלו שואבת במידה רבה מרבי משה בן מימון, למשל. המעריצים מבינים את הדברים האלה; יש להם את היכולת האינטלקטואלית להעריך באמת את עומק הבדיחות האלה, להבין שהן לא סתם מצחיקות - הן אומרו משהו עמוק על החיים. כתוצאה מכך אנשים שאינם אוהבים את דוד אריה הם באמת אידיוטים - כמובן שהם לא יעריכו, למשל, את ההומור בביטוי הקיצי של אריה, \"אֵין כְּמוֹ לִהְיוֹת ג'וּק!\", שהוא בעצמו התייחסות מוצפנת לדפוסיו של תיאודור זאב הרצל. . אני מגחך כרגע רק מלדמיין שאחד מאותם הבורים הללו מגרד את ראשו בבלבול כששנינותו הגאונית של ינץ לוי נפרשת על גבי דפי הספר אל מולם. אילו שוטים .. כמה אני מרחם עליהם. 😂 וכן, אגב, יש לי קעקוע של דוד אריה. ולא, אתה לא יכול לראות את זה. הוא נועד עבור עיני הנשים בלבד - וגם אז הן צריכות להוכיח שהן לפחות 5 נקודות משכל משלי (עדיף נמוכות יותר). זה לא אישי ילד 😎הפסקה מטונהפארק ממים על טונה וטונהפארק יהיו בבאן לתקופה קצרה בגלל שמשתמשים בהם יותר מדי. אנחנו לא רוצים סיטואציה של \"איכס לעז\" ידינו. אנחנו מעריכים את ההתלבות וההשתתפות אבל אני ושאר המודים מנסים מאוד להימנע מטעויות שסאבים אחרים עשו לפנינו ואנחנו צריכים להתחיל לפעול כבר עכשיו. מהיום ועד ההודעה החדשה יש באן על מימס של טונה וטונהפארק. הבאן יחל ב12 בצהריים מחר (16 לדצמבר) כדי שיהיה לכם הזדמנות אחרונה לשחרר את כל מה שיש לכם לפני שמתחיל. הבאן הוא רק זמני כדי שנוכל להתפתח ביחד ולשחרר טיפה מהבסיס של הסאב וכשצוות המודים יחליט הוא יגמר. אם יש לכם מקרה מיוחד שאתם חושבים שיש לכם מימ ממש קורע לגבי טונהפארק בצורה יוצאת דופן אתם יכולים לפנות אליי בפרטי ברדיט (u/ilayshenbrun) או בדיסקורד (משיח#3217) אם הוא מוציא סינגל או אלבום חדש אנחנו נאשר מימס עליו. תודה על הקריאה ועל ההשתתפות!הראנט שלי על זבובים מה זה בכלל זבוב כאילו איזה סוג של חרק זה? כאילו פשוט פאקינג זבוב באמת אין לי מושג מה זה כאילו סוג של מקק? חיפושית? ולמה בכלל יש הבדל בין זבובים לשאר החרא כאילו בין חרקים ודברים כאלה כמה קטן צריך להיות בשביל להפסיק להיות חיה רגילה ולהפוך להיות חרק ואיך זבוב זה לא ציפור כאילו אני לא מומחה בציפורים וזבובים ויש שם משהו מוזר אני בטוח שהם לא אותו דבר אבל תכלס למה זה לא פשוט ציפור להגיד את האמת זה די בזבוז לכתוב את כל זה רק על זבובים כי הם הדבר הכי מסריח בעולם כאילו אלוהים פשוט הפסיק לשים זין כשהוא יצר אותם אפילו שאני לא מאשים אותו גם אני הייתי משתעמם בסופו של דבר אבל כאילו כמה חיה יכולה להיות מסריחה ומכוערת כאילו הם אשכרה אוהבים חרא, חרא אמיתי של בני אדם אם המילה 'מוגלה' הייתה חיה היא הייתה זבוב כנראה אני חושב שאם הייתי מוחץ זבוב הוא היה עושה קראנץ' ואין לי מושג אמיתי כי אני לא ניסיתי למחוץ זבוב זה די מגעיל אבל יותר מחרקים אחרים הם לא סתם ימחצו הם יושמדו ואני לא מפנטז על למחוץ זבובים או משהו אבל אני סתם מתעניין מעניין כמה בריכות כל הזבובים בעולם יוכלו למלא זה אחד מהדברים האלה שאף פעם לא שמים אליהם לב אבל יש זבובים בכל מקום זה כמו נמלים שאף אחד לא שם לב לכל אחד בנפרד אבל הם פשוט בכל מקום באופן אוטומטי זבובים פשוט נמצאים בכל מקום בברירת מחדל כנראה שיש בבית של מלכת אנגליה זבובים ואין לה מושג היא אפילו לא שמה לב מתוך כמה שהם נמצאים בכל מקום תכלס זה מוזר שזבובים הם שעירים מקרוב כאילו הם כנראה יותר שעירים ממני ואני די פאקינג שעיר ברור שיש להם פחות שיער באופן כללי אבל ביחס לגוף בואנה בטח יש להם שיער על איזה 95% מהגוף הייתי מחפש בגוגל אבל אין סיכוי שמישהו בדק כמה זבובים יש באופן כללי הנה שוב פעם יש כאילו זבובים בכל מקום אבל עדיין אני לא מצליח להחליט בין איזה 20 מיליון זבובים ל50 מליארד הולי שיט מה אם יש 5 מיליאד זבובים בעולם זה די פאקינג מפחיד אם הם היו מתאגדים היה הלך עלינו דקה אני בודק כמה זבובים יש הולי שיט יש 17 קוואדריליון אני לא יודע אם אני רוצה להקיא או לבנות מבצר גרעיני עכשיו אני מבין למה יש זבובים בכל מקום וזבובים קיימים כבר 65 מיליארד שנה זה די מפחיד ומגעיל אני מתחרט על מה שכתבתי עם הבריכה אני מדמיין שאם באמת היה כלכך הרבה זבובים בבריכה הלמטה יהיה ממש רטוב זבובים הם חיה רטובה כזו מגעילה כשהייתי קטן לא ידעתי את ההבדל בין דבורה לזבוב כאילו ברור שידעתי אבל הם היו כזה כמו אחים אחד של השני בשבילי אני לא מבדיל לפי עוקץ או מראה אני מבדיל לפי גודל כאילו פעם הייתי מבדיל עכשיו ברור שאני יודע את ההבדל אבל פעם הייתי מתבלבל בין מלא דברים כאלה אבל יש את האלה שאני ממש זוכר שהם שישי ושבת, תל אביב וירושלים, וזבובים ודבורים מה בכלל הצבע של זבובים? אני כאילו חום כזה? סגול כהה? אם היו שואלים אותי הייתי עונה חום בלי לחשוב אבל תכלס אני לא בטוח אולי זה בורדו? אני בטוח שזה צבע כזה כהה אולי אפילו כחול כהה כזה או ירוק כן זה בטוח משהו כזה וואלה יש כלכך הרבה מה לדבר על זבובים בטח יש מקצוע זבובים כאילו כמו דבורן יש מישהו שמטפל וחוקר זבובים זבובן אולי? אפילו שזה די מסריח פשוט כמקצוע יחיד לך תהיה רופא או עורך דין ואם ממש דחוף לך החיות אולי אריות חיה מגניבה או משהו לא אחת שנמצאת על חרא תמיד אנשים שאוהבים זבובים בטח יש להם קטע עם חרא וואלה למה זיקיות אוהבות זבובים כאילו למה דווקא זבובים אם אני אביא להם צ'יפס זה לא מספיק טוב? כאילו הם לא יאכלו? כמובן חתיכה קטנה שתיכנס אני לא סדיסט אני לא רוצה לראות זיקיות מתות מה אם תמיד יש זבובים ליד חזירים כי הם חברים הכי טובים אפשר לעשות מזה סדרת ילדים אולי אני אמכור את זה לנטפליקס נטפליקס קונים הכל אם הם לא קונים את הסדרה שלי אני מתאבד בואנה תדמיינו שהקריירה שלכם בתור תסריטאי התחילה מסדרה על חזירים וזבובים זה יהיה די עלוב ובאופן כללי דרך עצובה להתחיל את הקריירה שלך אפשר לכתוב אלבום שלם לזבובים כאילו שיר לכל פעולה שהם עושים שיר כשזבוב עף, כשהוא עומד על חרא, כשהוא הורס לך את האוכל, חרא כזה ולמה זבובים כלכך אוהבים לעמוד על אוכל כאילו למה הטעם שלהם קופץ כלכך מהר בין חרא לאוכל שלי אין שום דבר בין לבין אם הם לא היו כאלה חתיכות של חרא הם בטח היו אוכלים בשר או משהו אבל הם חלשים מדי יש כוורת של זבובים? זה נראה לי הגיוני שהם יחיו ביחד אבל בחיים לא שמעתי על זה יכול להיות שזה סתם זה שאני הייתי מתבלבל בין זבובים ודבורים אולי זה עדיין טיפה בתוכי למה זבובים תמיד משפשפים את הידיים שלהם זה נראה כאילו הם שוטפים ידיים אפילו שהם החיה הכי מסריחה ביקום מה אם הם באמת שוטפים אותם לפני שהם עומדים על האוכל שלנו זה ישנה לגמרי את כל מה שאני חושב על זבובים כאילו גם אני מחרבן אבל אני שוטף ידיים אחרי אם הם באמת עושים את זה הם די מנומסים אפילו שאין סיכוי חחחח דמיינו זבוב עם עניבה או פפיון זה יהיה די מגניב זבובים הם די מגניבים כשלא מתייחסים לכמה שהם מגעילים כמובן שאם כן מתייחסים לזה אני עדיין לא אוהב ואתה די מגעיל אם אתה כן אוהב זבובים אבל תכלס הם פשוט כמו בני אדם קטנים עושים חרא ושוטפים ידיים ואז שמים עניבה ופפיון אם הייתי חיה הייתי זבוב כנראה כאילו אני לא מתיפייף כמו אנשים שאומרים שהם יהיו אריה או נמר הם די חתיכות של חרא אני אהיה זבוב ואני גאה בזה כן אני אהיה זבוב אני אדם פשוט אני לא רוצה להיות אריה אני רוצה להיות זבוב מנומס כזה יפה עם שיער מסודר ועם סטייל אתם לא איזה קניה ווסט אין לכם זכות להגיד שאתם אריה בכלל זה עלבון כלפי האנושות כולה תכלס אם רוב האנשים היו שואלים אותי הייתי אומר להם שהם זבובים וזה לא עלבון זבובים הם אחת החיות הכי פילוסופיות שיש הם שם למעלה עם זאבים וצבים אולי בנשמתי אני זבוב אולי בצורה מסויימת, כולנו זבובים בנשמתנו? אולי כולנו נועדנו להיות זבובים מול היקום הענק הזה? חסרי מעשה, חסרי משמעות? נולדים אל תוך הנטל של קיומיות בשביל לעמוד על חרא? כן. אני יכול להגיד בביטחון, ועם כל נשמתי, שכולנו זבובים בתוך תוכנו.How do I approach creating worlds in Cinema 4D and Unity? My Brother and I are making a game in unity. I already reached a level of graphic fidelity we are comfortable. But I don't know how I take these rules and techniques I have built for myself and apply them to an entire level. The level is basically a long street full of small cyberpunk houses and stores. I basically did one very small store and the street next to it, and then tried doing a bigger building but It was too hard. I really don't wanna disappoint my brother because I committed to the project. I'm most fluent in Cinema 4D but I also have Maya and Blender. If you have any tips, tutorials, tools, or suggestions it would be amazing. Thanks.התאוריה של ווסלי כל כושי הוא כוכב, כן, כל כושי הוא כוכב כל כושי הוא כוכב, כן, כל כושי הוא כוכב כל כושי הוא כוכב, אה מי יכחיש שאני וגם אתה כל כושי הוא כוכב? הכה אותי! כאשר ארבע פינות הגולם הזה יתנגשו אתה תחליק מבין הסדקים נאחז בתקווה שתשרוד אסוף את משקלך, הבט עמוק פנימה האם אתה באמת האדם אשר הם מהללים? לסרסר פרפר בראשית באמת אהבתי אותך אך כעת איני חפץ בדבר מלבד משגל לילות מאוחרים בהם חשבתי עליך עד שאקבל את אגוזי נזרק ונהפך, לקח נלמד היית בת זוגתי הראשונה גשרים נבערו בכל רחבי הלוח נהרס, אבל בשביל מה? כאשר אחתום על חוזה הקלטות, אתנהג כמו שוטה אפגע ברחבת הריקודים, נורות אורות בחדר חטוף את המזכירה הזנזונת הקטנה שלך בשביל החברים שטן כחול עיניים עם קוף שמן אקנה קאדי חדש בעלת גלגלי 'ווג' תאי את מכסה המנוע למעלה, פעמיים, דוס ארבע פלטינה על כל דבר, פלטינה על חתונה נשוי למשחק ולכלבה שובבה כאשר אחתום על חוזה הקלטות, אקנה אקדח הישר מה- CIA, הניח אותו על ברכיי קח כמה מכוניות M-16 למכסה המנוע העבירו את כולם על הבלוק, מה המצב? אני אכין את מפגש ההחלפות של קומפטון בבית הלבן רפובליקנים רצים, נרתעים הכה את הפרז עם חוליה קובנית על צווארי לא מלומד, אך קיבלתי המחאה של מיליון דולר לא היינו אמורים, מעולם לא היינו אמורים לתת לכושים כסף, חזרו אל ביתכם כסף, חזרו אל ביתכם לא היינו אמורים, מעולם לא היינו אמורים לתת לכושים כסף, חזרו אל ביתכם כסף, חזרו אל בית בראשית באמת אהבתי אותך אך כעת איני חפץ בדבר מלבד משגל לילות מאוחרים בהם חשבתי עליך עד שאקבל את אגוזי נזרק ונהפך, לקח נלמד היית בת זוגתי הראשונה גשרים נבערו בכל רחבי הלוח נהרס, אבל בשביל מה? ברכות, זה 'דר דריי, זוכר את הפעם הראשונה בה יצאת אל הבית? אמרת שאתה חפץ במקום כמו שלי אך זכור, כל שוטה יכול להשיג את זה החלק הקשה הוא לשמור עליו. במה אתה חפץ? בית? מכונית? ארבעים דונם ופרד, פסנתר, גיטרה? הכל, שמי הוא הדוד סם, אני בן בריתך אתה יכול לגור בקניון אני מכיר את בני עמך אין לך קבלות שלם לי אחר כך, חבוש את הגטורים האלה ספר קלישאות ואז אמור \" לעזאזל עם השונאים\" אני יכול להביט באדם העשיר שבך אני יכול לראות את הדולר שבך שקרים לבנים קטנים, אך אין בזה שום צווארון לבן אך זה לא משנה כי אני עדיין עוקב אחריך כי אתה גורם לי לחיות לנצח, ספור את הכל ביחד, ואז הכה בקופה וגרום לי להרגיש טוב יותר ההורוסקופ שלך הוא מזל תאומים, שני צדדים אז עדיף שתספור את הכל פעמיים שני קופות, שתי רשתות, שתי תווי סי יותר מדי לא מספיק, שנינו יודעים חג המולד, ספר להם מה ברשימת המשאלות שלך קח את הכל, זה מגיע לך קנדריק וכאשר אתה פוגע בבית הלבן, נכון אך זכור, אתה לא עובר כלכלה בבית הספר וכל מה שאתה קונה, המיסים יכחישו אני אעשה לך \"ווסלי סנייפס\" לפני שלושים וחמש כן, כאשר אני מסתכל מטה, זוהי נפילה גדולה נראה טוב כאשר אתה למעלה קיבלת מדליה עבורנו המטפורות של ליווין מטאפיזיות במצב של אופוריה הסתכל בשני הכיוונים לפני שאתה חוצה את קו המחשבה שלי אנחנו אף פעם לא צריכים לתת, אנחנו אף פעם לא צריכים לתת כסף כושים, חזור הביתה כסף, חזור הביתה לא היינו אמורים, מעולם לא היינו אמורים לתת לכושים כסף, חזרו אל ביתכם (איש המס מגיע) כסף, חזרו אל ביתכם (איש המס מגיע) לא היינו אמורים, מעולם לא היינו אמורים לתת לכושים כסף, חזרו אל ביתכם (איש המס מגיע!) כסף, חזרו אל בית (איש המס מגיע!)How different is playing basslines on a guitar? Been wanting to pick up bass for about a year now and I recently started learning basslines on my guitar. It may sound strange for someone who plays bass but I think it would honestly be easier on bass than it is on a guitar. Obviously, slapping is off the table, but I'm still trying to learn so I wouldn't buy a bass and stop playing it. Now, it is a lot of fun, but I want to know how different it would be on an actual bass. Just so you know, I never held an actual bass and I am playing on an acoustic guitar. Any help will be appreciated, especially from people who have had similar experiences or have the ability to check with a guitar.Hoarse voice due to puberty... I used to sing a lot around up until 6th grade and I remember being pretty good for the amount of time I was doing this, and in general I had a good, clear voice and no problem hitting both really high and pretty low notes.. In the summer my voice started changing extremely quickly and with the shift in tone and pitch, it started being very hoarse. My throat was very sore for about 2 months and It's still very hoarse. I didn't sing for about 2 - 3 years and I don't know if I'm really in the mood currently to keep on singing, but I'm 15 and this is still happening and maybe I'll want to sing again in the future. are there any solutions for this hoarseness, and will it pass when my voice stops changing? Any help will be appreciatedCan't change texture with vertex map. Tried to change between two textures with vertex maps. I tried a few solutions like using the mixed material in octane, using a layer or colorizer in the standard renderer materials, also tried to change the alpha of two materials to blend between them, nothing seems to be working. I did check that the vertex map is changing, and tried to use a noise texture to make sure that the problem is in the vertex map. (it is) Another solution to how to change between the materials will be nice, but I do actually want to solve why isn't it working because it is not the first time I have encountered this type of problem with vertex maps. I'm using R19 (Because all my plugins are there) Edit: I'm using the blended texture on a realflow mesh. I tried it on a normal plane and it did work.I'm looking to switch from Unity to Unreal... Where do I start with coding? Recently my unity projects started getting more graphics intensive and unity is just not keeping up... I've seen a lot of unreal demos and it looks like the best place to move forward with my skills considering I already have a very good background with graphics. I think this side of Unreal will come very naturally to me because I already know how to use Maya, Blender, C4D, all of these things. The things is, I can't find a good place to learn how to switch from C# to C++ without learning the basics of programming logic again, which I already know based on my experience with Unity. I just want to learn how to convert my knowledge from C# to C++. Any tips, tutorials, or resources that could be useful?badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadba badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbabadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadgoodbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbaCan't compile when using \"full compile - both - final\" It just pops up some yellow text... &#x200B;

I hate waking up knowing that I have to go through the entire day today. How do I bring back taste into my life? how do I become happy knowing that another day is about to start?My life is so boring I don't enjoy anything anymore I used to do so many things and now I'm just waiting for the day to end.

Every 12-year-old kid thinks that showing that he knows the lyrics to bohemian rhapsody means he's Oldschool and has good taste in music. (In my opinion) queen is one of the greatest bands of all time and for some reason, people think that liking their obviously good music makes them unique. I cant play bohemian rhapsody in my school anymore without someone starting to shout the lyrics. people listen to this song so much that it kinda ruined it for me, how many times can I hear the same song?. I became a Queen fan about a year before the movie came out and when it did, everyone who saw thought that they had amazing taste in music and that being a queen fan makes them stand out. Queen is such a good band with so much good other songs that it's disappointing how everyone got stuck on that song and how everyone thinks it's special to like it.My friend is copying me. Well I'm pretty young and I think that I have a lot of achievements for my age (14) I know how to write code in c#, I play piano, and I make animations in Maya / Blender / Cinema 4d but I have a friend that can't stop trying to do everything that I do. For some reason in the last year, he decided to do everything I do. He decided to start learning blender, write code in python, learn how to play piano, and I can't stand it. maybe I'm exaggerating but it's awful. it's like he doesn't want me to have my own personality. I don't want to talk to him about my life because every time I do he starts doing it again.Thank you man, I just don’t understand, my dad won’t admit to doing any of these things, isn’t willing to go to therapy, i think I’ll be fucked up in the head after this one. Everybody gets so attached, fooled by temptations. We humans have fallen victim to our senses and that’s exactly why people have fall outs, because usually one person can’t stand to feel alone. Sounds like we all need some behavioral help, emotional intelligence is key in these situations. We are just apes that think we are smarter but really have become pettyI see where you all are coming from it makes me feel better. I’m having that issue with my grandfather who’s visiting, he’s always making snobby remarks and super religious. I went off on him last night and basically told him he’s a shit talker and I don’t need people like that in my life. Something clicks inside of me and I let it all out on him for his rude ass remarks in front of my father, all he does is shit on younger people and he thinks he’s king of the house. I’ve had flashbacks when he said that last night and I couldn’t help it.Perfect timing! Just had a talk with my dad and he gave me the silent treatment, I sat there talking for 3 hours straight with no response. Was telling him how I am indeed a failure and how they can’t accept me for that, I’m not their little program that will blindly follow whatever, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective too man, I know what’s wrong with me and they continue to try and make me feel inferior which usually bites them in the ass because they should know by now what my issue is, instead they put me down and try to bully me. I understand what you mean it’ll be alright, they grew up in an era where hiding was normalI stopped on June 3rd, for probation, I think I definitely get more paranoid/anxious at moments. But I’m telling myself constantly to remember what it was like to smoke weed. “Just chill” is the main message I got from weed. Weed definitely helped me not care what people think lol. Also I’m more energized I feel like, say if I’m out walking around for a while I won’t be as fatigued and feeling worn out while sober. It’s definitely different but it’s worth stopping for 12 months or so, because the alternative would be you know what. Hope this helpsYes because they are agents, it’s their duty to fake identity that way they attract more fake people to make you feel overwhelmed. Don’t believe the scheme you gotta see through the false reality people set up in front of you or you’ll always be a victim of their low level reality game. Sounds crazy but I find this works. See through it, they are just temporary sheep passing by they need each other to feel stronger and could give a. Fuck about you because your already stereotyped by them. Spend more time alone and you will become stronger.Yeah but I’ve found using words to define your reality only makes you a robotic. It’s about letting go of words and stop thinking of your soul as a machine that you tell what to do lol. And I agree 100% on nature. This quote didn’t make me happy either but what makes me happy is going shooting in nature target practice, or digging for arrowheads down at the river. I don’t have friends by the way I’ve learned how to be alone, especially because of the society we live in. It’s easier to sit back and watch people go nuts to fit into a broken world. I think just breathing around nature anywhere and listening to music is all everyone needs you know. And quit looking into mirrors guys. It’s a journey of exploration of your own head not the universe you physically seeYep I’ve ran into foxes. I think it’s because we start to tune into the roots of humanity so you notice more instinctual things instead of just going about your day and looking at screens walking around buildings, etc. basically you become an ancestor of 1600s or earlier for 12 hours. And your experiencing all your ancestors past lives and behaviors and your DNA is showing you what’s inside you. To sum it up psychdelics show you Instinctual things that you cannot ignore. It only shows your what you ignore when your sober being a robotI’ve been up all night and was up all day before tonight, I took my 50mg vyvanse at 1am it’s now 6am. All I feel is confusion and kinda weak, I do this on and off depending on how late I wake up. Sometimes I just like to be tweaked off my ass cleaning and working out in the middle of the night. To each their own. But yes I will be sleeping here soon, many times have I stayed up all night then pop another one to stay up all day it isn’t good on the body #1 and #2 you are very fatigued the next day. Once you are used to being uncomfortable it becomes easier to handle lol. PeaceHighs aren’t real the only thing that real is your brain working faster and connecting different pathways which is all normal and can be done without drugs. Quit being a lame “let’s get high” person realize the high is nothing and progress. Lol if you think you trip harder than yes you probably do no need to ask others who are probably on their own life trip. Everyone’s reality is different you can ask a question and people might agree but they might be thinking of a come pletly different thing that they have thought of in their reality. But to answer your question, Yes I thought that when I was just starting my journey and now it’s just normal nothing cool. One loveNot real, you are struggling to hold on to your ego which you believe to be yourself. Been diagnosed all that shit lol I just learned how to let go stop thinking and just do people will judge oh yes but fuck em all. Nah but seriously when you microdose it’s not some magic that will cure shit you have to maintain the focus and creativity it gives you, start working out and stop overthinking the thinking. When you get stuck in the matrix you get diagnosed with illness, use the matrix to your advantage. Enough trip talk time to go back to my matrix and focus on other shit. Nice speaking to you fellow soldier. Lol one loveMy SO and I are 24 but he has Rhumitoid Arthritis (or something... may be something else) and about a month or two ago he lost his job. Hes always had issues with enflamed joints but the last month its gotten so bad in his hips that he actually asked me to get him a cane (he is very proud so this was a big deal) . Now its gotten to the point where just getting up to go to the bathroom is really hard for him. This morning he asked me for help with getting out of bed. Hes always not been good at feeding himself and that has always worried me. Im the kind of person who is a caregiver type where ill try to fix people around me's issues (if that makes sense) but have shied away from caregiver jobs because i tend to give too much. I guess i have troubles with boundaries. Anyways, lately hes needed more help than before... and i willingly give it to him because i love him and i care about him and i live with him... but im also scared. He says this isnt going to last forever that he will get his mobility back in his legs but i know that theres no way he can know that for sure. I feel trapped a little because i dont want to be a caretaker and i feel like theres some things he should be able to do for himself but since i dont feel his pain im having troubles knowing where i need to set boundaries that are reasonable. Today i realized he doesnt eat unless i bring him food and yet doesnt want a mini fridge in the room he is in most of the time. I might just move it in there anyways... for my own sanity. I dont know who to go to cuz this is heavy stuff i dont want to burden people i love with this heavy stuff but i need to vent. He jusg got laid off of his job and i dont know that he can get a job the way he is. I guess a desk job would work but RA gets worse if you use your body less.I used to be religious and fought with feelings of shame for wanting sex and even was made to go to aa meetings for my \"sex addiction\" even tho id never had sex. It was hard to peel away from the church but now that i dont associate with religious ideas anymore, ive been a lot more happy with sex. I wasnt able to get away from being lds until i moved away from my family and was able to not answer to anyone but myself. Dont get me wrong. Theres some really great things about religion (like how it brings community) but sex isn't one if them.Its such a good movie. Defintely makes you take a step back and realize how fragile reality really is. About therapy, i know it can be hard but just know that your therapist has an outside view and hopefully unbiased view. Therapy is one of those things that takes time. If you have the means i would recommend going to therapy once a week for a few years. It can really help things. Weird that it happens in the evening... Not that you will go to some asylum but asylums arent things to be afraid of. They are built for people who need extra help coping with things. Not something to be afraid of. It would probably by more like a safe place where people can get help they need. Dont be afraid to tell your parents. Maybe write them a letter if its hard to talk about?I was going to say to see a doctor but i would definitely tell your parents if you are younger. Tell them that you hear things, tell them that it scares you. If they dont believe you keep bringing it up. Side note... if you have netflix theres an awesome movie on there called my beautiful broken brain about a woman who had a seizure and was left unable to speak or read or write. She also had things in her vision on her right side(like the right eye saw things). This is her story of how her life was changed and she had some scary things happen to her and paranoia and she kept sane by recording it and watching it later. Keep in mind that the brain is an imperfect thing and sometimes it makes you believe something that isnt actually happening. Talk yourself through it. You are okay. You are safe. Give yourself care and attention when scary things happen and be kind to yourself. Best of luckI grew up in a strict mormon household. I am now 24 and they didnt help me by saying i couldnt have sex until i was married. I had a mean labito and ended up sleeping with random people just to have sex with someone who didnt know me or couldnt shame me... its like a pendulum. They held me all the way to one side and when i broke away from it and moved out, the pendulum swung all the way to the other side and i got chlamidya and lost my vorginity to a stranger among other things that werent so good. Over the years the pendulum has lost its momentum and im finally finding my happy middle.I dont think it matters if it exists or not. If it does exist and there is one person out of the 7 billion people in the world right now, chances are youre not going to find them. Also i dont believe in love at first sight because at first sight you have all of these fantasies about the person that probably arent true. You learn about people as you talk with them. But i do believe that two people can learn to coexist with one another and form a strong bond. But i dont think that holding out for that one person is a good use of time.Step 1: Buy Elder base w/ RF enchant (2ex) Step 2: Slam Essence of Horror(30% more ele dmg) until T1 burning This step took me about 70 essence of horror Step 3: Exalted slam(3Ex), hit T1 % mana (removed lock suffix, not needed) Step 4: Mavens Orb to get elevated Burning Not to sure if I could have locked suffix and mavens orb to garuntee Step 5: Exalt slam 2 slots until Lvl 20 Conc If you don't hit conc on either slam, lock suffix, scour, and go again. This step only took 2 suffix locks to hit (8Ex) Step 6: Crafted life and spammed to perfect, not entirely sure if +1 AOE would be better I am not done crafting this item, but this is where I landed in the process. Not sure if I can lock suffix and mavens orb for a 50/50 on the conc effect.The situation: You have a PERSON you are detaining. They break free and strike an officer, twice. The PERSON is aggressive and non-compliant. Those are the facts. If you want to differentiate this person by anything else, that's your prerogative. &#x200B; Just know this, when you start trying to attach identifiers to a person, you are A) ignoring the fact that this is a person attacking another person and B) saying that this type of behavior is okay. &#x200B; So we're on two separate sides of the coin; I think that that persons actions led to reaction, and you think their reaction is wrong.I somewhat agree, mainly that you're not applying for loans every day. And I also agree that there is a margain where it doesn't really matter, and those margins are below 650 and above 800, from my experience. Of course credit rating isn't everything, because you have to have income power. What I don't agree with is downplaying credits role. Pretending like credit rating doesn't impact your day to day life is downright wrong. Credit rating can be the difference of paying $250/mo on a car loan and not $350-$400. Good credit rating means you have more ability to take on more debt, and get nicer things at cheaper rates. And again, just because you haven't had to take on credit recently doesn't mean you should be giving the advice of \"ignoring it\" and saying \"your score doesn't mean jack shit\".I think something might have been missed. We liked Harvest league, it wasn't an annoyance. I liked setting up the plots for the most efficient space of limited land. My buddies and I spent weeks setting it up and perfecting it. The money was great, buying bulk seeds was fun when you learned the proper channels, because sometimes you'd get some really good seeds for cheap. This was all because people simply didn't care about min/maxing their prices, which feeds into the mass inconvinience that was Harvest. To drive my point though, Harvest was an all around great league for my group of friends. It wasn't just because it was money, but the mechanic itself was engageable/highly repeatable and offered a source of deterministic crafting.Hi, Reddit. I'm a user who enjoys 'poe' in Korea. I made armor over a few days and I want to let you know so I write on Reddit for the first time. &#x200B; Explain how to make armor. 1. I chose essence as the way to raise the dex the most. (Deafening Essence of Sorrows) 2. I made '10% chance to gain a Frenzy Charge on Hit' with Essence for the work of Suffix. In this process, about 180 essence were used. (Sometimes there are indelible options, and sometimes there are times when you need to come back to the beginning.) 3. I used 'Add influence' after I filled the prefix. (Prefixes can use lightning, cold, craft.) 4. Then use 'Rem/Add influence' to obtain the Dex #%. If the option '10% chance to gain a Frenzy Charge on Hit' disappears, we will go back to 2. I've rewrote influence about 7 to 8 times. 5. If you've come this far, you'll have 'chance to gain a Frenzy Charge on Hit + DEX # (Essence) + Dex #%' in the Suffix. Now use seed crafting to erase all of the options in the Prefix! 6. I've made a lot of attempts here and gone through a number of ways. &#x200B; The first option is to take care of the options of 'Enemies you Kill Explode, dealing #% of their Life as Physical Damage'. Here's how. '#% of Physical Damages from Hits taken as Lightning Damages' and '#% of Physical Damages from Hits taken as Cold Damages' are made using seed crafting. After that, we give them physical. And if you're not Chris, you'll have the option 'Reflects #Physical Damage to Melee Attackers'. If you have the option of 'Enemies you Kill Explode, dealing 3% of their Life as Physical Damage', please leave. I'm afraid of those people. We can use 'Rem/Add Phy' whenever we have 'Reflects #Physical Damages to Melee Attackers'. If '#% of Physical Damages from Hits taken as Lightning Damage' and '#% of Physical Damages from Hits taken as Cold Damages' are un-repairable, 'Enemies you Kill Explode, dealing #% of their Life as Physical Damages' are successful. After that, use 'remove lighting&cold'. If the 'Reflects #Physical Damage to Melee Attackers' option remains, the probability is 50/50. If you succeed in this process, you can get 'Enemies you Kill Explode, dealing #% of their Life as Physical Damage' from Prefix. After that, I have to put one influence in Prefix. The option I want is '+1 to Level of Socketed Support Gems'. But I gave up this method in this process. I did \"Remove/Add Influence\" because I couldn't find what I wanted, but I've experienced \"Explode\" three times. But you may succeed. I used 'Rem/Add phy' more than 150 times in this process. I used 'Rem/Add Influence' 9 times. I gave up that method and took another one. &#x200B; To make 'Explode', you must first create '+1 to Level of Socketed Support Gems'. Here's how. Use 'Rem/Add Influence' until '+1 to Level of Socketed Support Gems'. There were about seven uses. And if you don't have patience, you don't have to read from now on. From here, it's not a fight against time anymore, it's a fight against yourself. The probability story is meaningless here. After using 'Add phy', I used 'Rem/Add phy' indefinitely until I got 'Explode'. The 'Rem/Add phy' consumed in the process is about 500 to 600 times. I don't recommend this method to you. I'm so stupid. Please let me know if there is a better way. Then I'll hate you. You don't want to hear how much my expended EX is. XD Actually, I don't remember either. \\-Posted for a friendYeah, you essence hit for 1 guarantee, and hit it until you get Lvl 20 conc. If the mods are all safe, purge/fill the prefix. You don't want any prefix that will mess up anything, so make sure it doesn't roll any of the 3 fire prefix. If it does, just remove it before continuing. There's the possibility for a bad roll, but there are only a couple. There are a few ways you can try and save it, but nothing is for sure if it rolls int/mana/rarity. &#x200B; Once you get to the point of the base having conc/30% more dmg, then you can fill the prefix (I did it with defence but you can do it safely with defense/life/caster). At this point, it's just about crafting fire res to pull it out of the mod pool. After that, we just aug fire/remove res/remove fire/craft fire res when it hit immolate. It takes a couple extra steps, but it's not worth the remove fire craft just to 50/50 off the stat (immolate in this case). Just easier to remove res and then remove fire. When it hit the -9 fire res, my buddy (Liger) hit it with a lucky aug fire and we got the level 20 burning. The reason we're removing/adding the fire res is A) it lets us safely remove the mod when we get something desirable and B) forces the helmet to roll a 1/7 Immolate/Burning/-9%.\\-Helmet (Warlord/Elder) <S>Essence Slam \"Horror\" 30% ele dmg <P>Dig for 20 Conc Effect (1/33) Lvl 20 Conc <P><P>craft 2 bad prefix(defx2) <S>Craft Fire res <S>Slam fire aug for Lvl 20 burn (1/7) Lvl 20 Burn \\-<S>Remove fire res/aug fire (50/50) -9 Max \\-<P>-<P>Remove Defencex2 <P>Aug Phys (1/2) 10% phys taken as Fire <P>Aug life T1 Life &#x200B; Edit: My personal soapbox.

Why on earth are you going to say something nice about something entirely different, or may not understand? If he said \"Hey I made a youtube video on building a shed, for chaos, can you say something nice?\" Now what is that shed is a POS? What if you know nothing about shed building. He gets positive affirmation on something that is potentially shit. You should get accolades for people randomly popping by and someone actually being interested. That's also what makes you grow, not buying positive comments.You can usually wait for some pretty good sales since they rotate daily. The currency tab is all but required at this point, and you'll need premium stash tabs if you want to have sales going while you play. Without premium tabs, you'll be at the mercy of trade chat, or learning the ins and outs of acquisition. Also, any time is a good time to buy supporter packs, since the goodies and points don't lose value. Another thing to note is if you buy a supporter pack, and you then buy random points, the dollar value can be put towards the next tier supporter pack at 60%. so for instance, you bought the $30 pack, then you bought a random $10 pack. That would count as $6 towards the next supporter pack (the points get deducted as well). So it's better to try and put that money into the next tier, but you aren't up a creek if you can only chip away towards the next pack. I hope that made sense.There really is no justification for being a cunt. And honestly I can see why you are such a cunt. If i didn't have the whole $1000 it takes to move to another country, I'd probably act like a brat as well. But I don't believe that's you're case, most responsible adults actually have a savings account, and I want to bundle you in that group as the low life's who keep talking about leaving. But in reality, You just want someone to hear you complain, and what better medium to have your complaints heard than with the other people who want to complain instead of actually work. So which is it? Are you some no life with no skills on being an adult or are a whiney bitch?Some of the tilesets are similar, but the lore has changed drastically. There are all sorts of new monster models and even boss fights. It's a shame you have to pass around bad information. ALSO- If you spent $60 for a few tabs....you could get: Div Tab, Essence tab, Currency Tab, Quad Tab, and 6 Premium tabs. That's essentially 13 stash tabs, if you count the quad as 4. AND ALSO-If you spent $60 and didn't get the supporter pack, which includes 2 weapon effects, and the entire MTX outlaw set, you are a dunce. And after spending all that, you still have 35 points left over. That is all if you spent it right now, and didn't want for the tabs to go on sale.You kinda have a funny side, because us not holding the UN and every other nation to current times, would have us living in the times of barbarism. There would be absolute chaos because these shit countries would be over-run with moral-less and corrupt leaders, ensuring a survival of the fittest. Then every special snowflake won't be allowed to live anymore, everyone then loses the right to live without the safety net. So then why bother accepting refugees, we owe nothing to them. They need to survive on their own. Why don't we wipe out every country that is opposed to us, in any way shape or form? Probably because we live in an advanced culture that doesn't live by the rules of zealots and crusades. That's why we're bombing these renegade nations, so they don't do the same to us. So they understand that it's not okay to use chemical warfare, especially on your own people.You still aren't understanding, or you really just don't care to understand. So ignorant or willfully ignorant. Stand your ground laws don't mean you can go shoot anyone for doing something to you. There has to be a reasonable fear or great bodily harm, rape, or death. A mugging without a weapon doesn't mean you can shoot him. You can chase him down or contact the police, but you are not authorized to shoot. Please never even consider getting your CHL. You would be the face of leftist anti-gun attempt because you think you can just go trigger happy. You are so disillusioned that you think it's actually okay to hit a pedestrian while trying to stop a mugger from running away. That absolutely is not okay, and people like you with reckless wanton disregard for the safety of anyone else, well, your arguments are completely invalidated. Have a good day, I am done with this guy.TIL Law and Order is gospel. You are twisting this to fit a narrative. But everything is different. If you discharge your firearm towards someone who stole your wallet, you are going to get a plethora of charges. You are escalating to deadly force when it's 100% unwarranted. You cannot shoot someone in the back who is running away. You cannot shoot someone who isn't intending to impose great physical harm, rape, or death. If he hasn't brandished something that even looks like a weapon, and you shoot, you're going to get locked up. If you hit a pedestrian and they get injured/died in this scenario, you're getting locked up. This is not talking about home protection, because that varies alot from state to state.Bro.....seriously? They keyboard degree really pays for itself. If someone is mugging you, you absolutely have no excuse for deadly force unless a weapon is being used, in the commission of the mugging. And then to say if you shoot them and injure a pedestrian, he'll get charged? If you had your CHL you would understand the basic rules to engaging a target. BTW, that is not the same scenario as two men robbing a store and one of them killing the clerk, etc. That is actually a situation where deadly force is authorized, because it fills the \"great bodily harm, rape, death\" that is required to be met in order to actually \"cap\" someone. Thinking you can be all pow-pow-texas-cowboy for simple theft, get the fuck outta here.I didn't care to edit and add export. I really do like your snooty remark, as it does add to the sense of \"I'm so much smarter than everyone\", but the fact of it is you're the ignorant one, shielded by your own lack of researching. Sure, the biggest import/export thing was a sarcastic jab, because...well.....liberals don't get to have all the embellishments. I am sorry you must be suffering from I-can't-search-so-counterpoints-are-all-lies, so this may help in your conquest to be more up to date on current events (BTW, this is from 2011, you're REALLY far behind, but it's never to late to catch up) http://www.npr.org/2011/12/04/143025654/migrants-say-theyre-unwilling-mules-for-cartelsIt doesn't have to say Made in the US, just as long as it doesn't say Made/Assembled in Mexico. Mexico has been a terrible neighbor for....well as long as I've been around. They have been nothing but a drain on our system and a foreshadow of what happens when absolute corruption takes over a country. They have been ENTIRELY taking advantage of the civil wars down south. The Cartels and Mexicans Governments biggest import is illegal immigrants, and you can be certain they have extorted as much money as possible from fleeing immigrants, to dump them on us.That's 40 million people. That's 40 million people who could learn English. The ones that refuse to learn English are right at the functioning level of a low function blind person, but even worse because they haven't adapted. And if you're so lovey dubby with illegal immigrants, do something about it, like house them. You don't understand the problem because it's not in your direct line of site. I live in a small town in Washington State that was already riddled with drugs. THEN we got a shit ton of Venezuelan refugees. And while that is the majority of the problem, we have left wingers defending their right to destroy cities, because of some garbage ass tree-hugging-everyone-deserves-to-live-in-America BS. What ever happened to survival of the fittest? What ever happened to nation first?For starters. Knock out all those 3 noded jewels (The two 4 manas top right and the 3 right next to scion (8 mana each)). Grab Dream on the right side of the scion wheel. I would also take out Puppet master and the nodes that line up to that. Then you can start working towards mental rapidity and nimbleness. But the thing also is......you gotta do the math in determining mana regen/cast. Because honestly with this buff to SRS, we may actually be able to use MoM. But that isn't viable for you since you're running ES. But I would first start by knocking out the aforementioned nodes. They don't do a whole lot for your minions. PS. Looking for that perfect jewel is already an absolutely terrible ordeal.You don't get discounts for previous purchases. During the current tier of supporter packs, if you make purchases without getting a supporter pack, the money spent will be added at 60% towards your next support pack. So lets say you spent $100 on points. Then you wanted to get a supporter pack(or the next tier) your money would be counted as though you put $60 towards the supporter pack. So if it cost $80 and you spent $100 on points, you would have to spend an additional $20 because you had $60 applied to it.I don't care for a few of his ideas. For starters, we just got a new zone. Greymist Isles. I am sure you've ran through it once, maybe twice. But I don't think we have to down like many of the other zones. Another thing I really don't like his having the pets pick up things automatically. We not to long ago got the vacuum loot, and that has been a godsend, but it's a case of \"If you give a mouse a cookie\". I also don't like that his number one point is complaining about grinding. I don't even know how to address this because simply put.....taking the grinding out of Hack N Slash ARPGs is just......well taking the game out of the game. It's a grindfest, maybe they can do more things to spruce it up, but to complain about grinding as though it's the worst thing in the game is just beyond me.I am kinda figuring out my stuff as well (got a 980Ti in March). I've been fighting between 144Hz@1920x1080 and 60Hz@ 3840x2160. Honestly though dude, I think the 980Ti was the better purchase. It's tried and true. You never know with the 1080/1070. They may come out with a list of bugs, they may have issues processing certain things. I honestly don't know what issues they could have, but don't expect those cards to run perfectly out of the gate. Another side note is you're going to be able to cruise through this whole next gen GPU with your 980Ti. You may not have the top of the line through it, but you're still going to have a very powerful card that is going to stay ahead of gaming for quite some time.There a certain protocols for just this thing. They will usually start keeping track of how long you've denied yourself food by the hour, once it starts, of course. Then there is a prescribed amount of time you can go without food/water before you get \"Force Fed\", which is generally a nasal pharyngeal and some pedialite. If you want to watch a movie of a wuss crying about force feeding, here's one. BTW, it hurts about 10x less then this guy makes it out to be, mild discomfort at most. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ACE-BBPRsI have a HC Wiz that I pushed GR71 with pretty early. I used the Ashnagarr's bracers with Galvanizing Ward, Spectral Blades-Barrier Blades and Magic Weapon-Deflection as my skills/passives. I would sometimes swap in Molten Wildebeasts Gizzard but did take that out for Esoteric Alteration. I had Unstable Scepter as my main weapon with a cubed Fragment of Destiny, as well as using Delsere's Belt, which gave Spectral Blades insane APS. I could ramp myself up to over 4mil shield. Here's a link to my profile: http://us.battle.net/d3/en/profile/gdp-1904/hero/71059766 If you have more questions, feel free to add me on b.net GDP#1904What's a bit unfair is that most of the information on that site is incorrect because it's inputted by randoms. While that link may be decent, this is still a shitpost because it has absolutely nothing relevant to 2.4. Most people are going to be trying out new builds with new items. If you want to find any relevant information to 2.4 and what class you want to play, search up that classes subreddit. You'll find alot more information, especially when seeing how things play out on the PTR. Icy-Veins and those guides aren't going to do that for you.Washington is a good place to check out. Especially if you get a high paying job in Seattle. The public trans is amazing here. I live fairly far away from Seattle (Around 2.5 hour drive), but I can condense it to around 1Hr 45Min commute if I schedule around using the ferry system. The ferry is about an hour and it takes me about 45 minutes to drive to it. Also. When my wife and I got an apartment. It was a 2bed in an okay neighborhood for $850/MO, but with a $1 security deposit that also covered 1st months rent.While they may be in solitary, they are not excluded from the world. And solitary confinement isn't indefinite. There are regulations that put time restrictions on solitary confinement based on infractions/offenders. The only way solitary confinement becomes indefinite is if the offender re-offends while in solitary confinement. If they've been locked up since 2000, they should have never used a smart phone. But that's not 100% the case, when guards get wrapped up, but that's another discussion entirely.Your information is 100% incorrect. Please know what you're talking about before you start trying to pass your ideas as fact. There is no X lvl rift unless it's lvl 70 and your friend made it. But after that, the rift scales with your characters level. As mentioned by /u/derkatron, up to a few screens away gets pre-loaded at your characters level, but that's as far as it goes. That's why your character will hit level 14 or so easily and then be slugged for a pack or two. Those mobs were preloaded as level 1, have lvl 1 HP and lvl 1 XP.It has happened to me with a few different girls. I ended up distancing them out. I felt it was for the best because I have really bad luck with situations looking really bad. For me personally, having situations were my wife can have doubt in me don't outweigh the comfort for both my wife and me in knowing there won't be any outside distractions. It works for us, but I know stove people who use the flirtations with people other then their significant other, because it helps with their drive. I don't know if I did what I was saying correctly. I am really tired.Search warrants are generally specific. And by that I mean....the court issues a warrant. Then the police fulfill the warrant. If the warrant is a bench warrant because an individual failed to appear, the purpose of that warrant is to detain the individual. If the warrant is because there is probable cause that the individuals in the house are selling drugs, they will go in, grab whoever is doing the drugs(everyone in the house that can be made an accomplice), and then search the house for drugs. Now anything else found not pertaining to the warrant is up for grabs as well. So if you are selling drugs and you have a loaded AK47 sitting in your closet, you just caught a weapons charge. A sheet of acid is a bit more specific, but there are ways for them to properly assess. Lets go back to the bench warrant, because that is a little trickier. So the individual is in the house at the time they present the warrant. The individual gets carted off. Now because it is something simple as a failure to appear, the police have no more business inside your house. The obligations of the warrant have been fulfilled. So the loaded weapon hidden in your closet is safe. But if that AK47 is within plain sight, that can be another weapons charge. The nitty gritty of it is.....warrants are specific and have specific guidelines/requirements. They can be fulfilled by arresting the person on the warrant, but can also end in civil forfeiture.If your car is getting jacked. Give them the car. You're a dumbshit on the next level. We're talking purely on the video. It was either a cop or a car jacker. Either way, you give up your car. Your mindset is why people like this kid get shot. But what more do you expect when the parents are even more irresponsible by teaching their retarded kid that it's a smart thing to drive away from a fucking drug deal when you're either A)getting mugged or B) getting arrested. I am glad I had good parents growing up that taught me how to NOT get shot and how to critically think. I am done with this conversation. To many fucking liberals hugging a dead criminal.Lol. What happened in Pennsylvania was fighting for a cause. And talking about a plane hijacking is another extreme circumstance. Attempting to evade police/a robbery, it's downright stupid. You'd face the same fate as that kid. Go ahead and rob me at gunpoint. That's a felony. And the cool story bro, there's a stronger possibility of survival. That's the funny thing about your generation though. You kids think it's all or nothing, either that or you play internet tough guy. There's no actual thinking with your actions. GG. Have fun with your criminal record or your 6ft plot.Easy to get into/impossible to master is not the winning formula to every single game. WoW vanilla was not easy to get into. Levelling was extremely rough and time consuming. Diablo 2 wasn't that easy to get into. You had to get specific items to make your build work. You couldn't make a build with just rares. The only games that come to my mind that follow the easy to get into/difficult to master are FPS. Okay, researching may not be integral, but the counter to that is trial and error. Most ARPGs have a research component that is enforced by trial and error. And even with things like Diablo 2, trial and error played a huge factor in the game. And lets talk about the hardcore vs casual, especially with your chess comparisson, to tie this all together. The amount of time you place into any of the tiers, beginner, casual, or hardcore, is going to be the main cause to how good you are. There are gifted naturals, but those are outliers. Now POE requires significantly more time to get at then D3. Whether you're talking about leveling, farming, grinding, trading, whatever. All of those things are more time intensive when you're playing POE. POE being for hardcore gamers is what it is.You missed the point man. I will re-iterate for you. It's about Networking. It's about talking to people and making friends. POE is not a casual game. I hate to break it to you, but it's for the hardcore ARPG enthusiast. You have to spend time researching. You have to spend time trading currency. You have to spend time making friends. You have to spend time grinding. These are all core fundamentals to an ARPG. If you don't enjoy doing ALL of those things, then POE isn't the answer. Those are the things that make POE infinite.Well like I said, networking is a huge thing. I found a COE back when lowlife ST was the shit. I ended up doing like a day long trade waiting for this guy to get the currency for it. He did, and we were BSing the whole time. Eventually we became friends. He was a really good player that was constantly at like rank 20 in levels on the leaderboard. He knew a couple of big names like Porter and KingCurrency. Then when the next league came around I met some more of his friends. Then we all became friends. We even crossed over into Diablo 3. Met some really good players, like a fella who constantly gets the 8/8 t-shirt. It's simply about how you network. I'll throw you a bone though man. When Dankshrine starts up, we may have a group going. If not, I'll make a group happen. And you'll be invited to join us.Give the guys at GGG a break. They are the reason D3 has actually picked up, with dozens of new and creative ideas. And D3 was only released as the pile of shit it was because there wasn't any actual ARPG competition. But lets look at what they've done thus far. For starters, Diablo 3 adapted the Rift system solely because POE had Maps. POE has created meaningful and difficult end game content (Uber Atziri). POE still has an effective trading market (and before you start talking about POE.Trade, that hasn't been around for forever, we figured out how to use the trade chat and people were still able to make currency). They just fixed their roll-the-dice mechanics for syncing with deterministic lockstep. POE is the way it is, because it's what the creators wanted. They aren't going to please everyone. Now to address your complaints. There is no need for automatic parties. Go out, make trades, make friends. I met one friend through trading, another through rushing, and those friends branched out and now I can generally get in a party of 4-5 doing high level maps at any point in the season. It's not that hard to network, if you know how to network. I would much rather play with friends anyways VS playing with randoms, but everyone has their own way. So.....D3 has automatic party, POE has \"talk to people\". PVP isn't a main focus in ARPGs, it hasn't been for a long while. Not since the days of D3 has there been a counter balance of classes. But again, the tradeoff is actual end-game content. All that Diablo 2 had for end game (not saying this is actual content) is PVP and Baal running, or even just straight botting. If you're looking solely for competition, fight your way through the Diablo 3 leaderboards. As for your last point, as mentioned above, deterministic lockstep. I feel that until you get into like GR60+, you're not going to really understand the tempo difference, because they both play about as fast if you're pushing any GR under that. End note: We're at a golden age of ARPGs, where we don't have to pick one game and stick with it. We can go out and play a game that suits are desires. I'll bounce between both POE and D3 because they both are great games in their own respects, and one will fulfill my current wishes more then the other.I think gaming is going in a positive direction. Yes it is a cash grab. But in return, we're getting more immersive gameplay. I personally stick to ARPGs, which is growing exponentially quick. The meta of those games is constantly changing, and we're having a huge battle between Blizzards Diablo 3 and GGGs POE. Both are getting far more ingenuitive then their predecessors. Two months ago, Diablo 3 released the Kanai Cube, which shifted the meta of most characters/classes into more combo basing than before. And POE is constantly tuning the meta with different/new items and monster affixes. If you've bought both games, you've spent $80 since D3+XPAC is $40 per and POE is F2P. It's just growing and growing. If ARPGs stop growing, and the market gets oversaturated with the same playstyle. If the ideas stop coming in and the graphics stay the same, and they ask for money ontop of no growth, then I'll feel the market is taking a turn for the worst. Currently, the world of ARPG's is probably the best market out there for gaming.Diablo 3 is a fickle beast. I thought I read somewhere that they realized people were only going to play for a period of time, and then trail off into other games. So the idea was to make people have as much fun as possible (Maybe someone can help me out with finding the blue post). So while this game does tend to fizzle out, they are consistently pushing the barriers with game design/ideas. Just like this seasons big idea was killing trials and bringing in the cube. It's progressed alot, even over the last year. You can be certain it will continue as the competitiveness of D3 only increases.No need for a \"fight the occupation\" rant, bud. Companies have been doing this for a long time. Should we boycott Ford because we can't take parts from that and put it in a Toyota? We've been blessed thus far with the ability of interchangeable parts, just so long as they can fit in the slots (Most of the time). People are going to buy into these things because they can. People are also not going to buy into them because they don't want to/can't afford it. You're in the latter. You're not going to start a revolution anytime soon.I am not sure where you're going with an \"Old Architecture\" when we're in the golden age of computers. A year ago, no one knew what 4k was, let alone how revolutionary it is. While not specific to those companies, they are integrating it well. Computers have been about being cutting edge, but other technologies are catching up quickly, and it's about how these companies adapt. So not only is a new company going to have to be innovative, it will also have to be adaptive. In summation, I don't think anything is going to take the steam out of these powerhouse hardware manufacturers, atleast not for another 5 years.It is 100% a bitch move. He just agreed to a contract and is now attempting to lump in 2017 into 2016 so he can renegotiate after the 2016 season. He's double dipping by trying to restructure to get more guarantee. Yes /u/DuesMexMachina is correct that they can cut players at any given time, but there is also alot of good faith that happens with teams, IE. Dante Fowler Jr of the Jags. Also, it's a very grueling sport, with alot of injury, but Kam is holding out on 900k. Which may seem like it's worth it, But the Seahawks put 8.1mil on the table (as a show of good faith) and he's saying 9mil. Everything about what he's doing is purely for greed. And if he's seriously that worried about injury and protecting his best interest, he should just retire.I know this is bad for Glasgow inhabitants but for me this is actually not that bad, already avoid areas with Orange Halls and the only place I'd really have to be careful is Kelvingrove Park but thats fine as I don't go there often. EDIT: Anyone who lives in the West End know specificaly how bad the walks are around there? I'm guessing they might add dates as it goes along but I don't know for sure? Also, how big are these walks? Are they like funeral-procession-for-dead-monarch size or pre-schools first outing size?Reddit is buggy so my comment got deleted - for some context my acne has been like this since the summer of 2021. Before then I only really washed my face in the shower with water then used a Simple-brand moisturiser. My mum thought this was gross so I went on a more stringent routine - full cleanser/moisturiser/toner combo morning AND night. Immediately my skin got worse, although I continued to use it as I thought it was \"purging\" - I was probably wrong, and my skin has been like this since. My diet is vegetarian but I only eat dairy once in a while. I only use Simple brand stuff as my skin is very sensitive. Should I just remove all this crap out of my life and go back to water and moisturiser?Cannot say. When I had to retake my driver's theory test I thought I would pass because my cubicle for the test was my favourite number. Then I failed. I retook it again and this time thought I would pass because of some other random thing I took as a sign I was going to pass. I failed again. I think I am more of a 'looking for signs' rather than 'seeing signs' type of person. Which is very detrimental. And for worries that have become a reality - very few. The only recent moment my worries came to fruition was when I failed my driving theory test, but this is mostly because I knew I was ill-prepared for it.***IMPORTANT UPDATE, PLEASE READ:*** As seen in comments, a couple of individuals involved in this 'drama' have come forward to present more accurate information and piece together a better picture than I had originally of the events that had unfolded. The Original Post is unfortunately riddled with many tidbits of misinfo, one most importantly that was thankfully corrected: the alleged suicide did not occur. Because of the complexity of the drama I am debating whether or not to keep up this post. I am not going to spread a misinformed account of these events to a wider audience especially as the most heavy topics discussed were not thought to have happened at all and causing unneeded stress about these events is uncalled for. Leaving this drama to rest is probably the best thing and I think that is of more importance than a Reddit Post. I had initially written it to jog the memory of anyone involved to see if there was more info available and how important this fiasco was to the community and I am glad I was able to reach out to others and gather a better picture of what had happened. Thank you.Most of the people involved in this story were unfortunately just the type of kids who spend an insane amount of time on the internet, and the more time you spend on the internet in very niche circles the more you're etiquette on treating others changes. And because of the anonymous nature of the internet it is frighteningly easy to forget who you're arguing with is a real human being behind the screen and will act in a very human nature to the things you will say, especially death threats and blackmail.Search For a Star was Phases 1.5/2 right? If so, then it wasn't. Iirc I found the audio on some random YouTube video showcasing the changes in voice actors for each member in each phase collected from various interviews, shorts, etc. The audio in question was played under 'Phase One Noodle' with just an image of her and the other members - no video. Noodle was congratulating winners with tangible prizes - things like a BMX bike or remote control cars if you get me, so it wasn't her congratulating them with a chance to collab. You'll have to forgive me as this was so long ago, but I hope that description makes sense ahahaI think try listening to the soundtrack instead of your own music, I don’t know if either your playing Stardew Valley via console or PC or Mobile but if it’s the former try drawing your attention to the feel of the console buttons/mouse and keys - this might sound stupid but when you put meaning into what your doing then your brain will automatically start to focus on it. I have the new AC and honestly while like Stardew Valley it can get a little monotonous as it’s all about routines I’d say you’ll find yourself more focused because it’s a new game - take note of how you play when your concentrating and try and adapt those habits into other games. There’s lots of dialogue, try not to skip it and think “this is boring!!” when you live in the ‘now’ your brain won’t worry about time, reading dialogue no matter how repetitive it is helps train the brain to concentrate on what’s happening currently and not in your mind. If you’re into video games try playing a rhythm game as it forces you to put a ton of focus into the ‘now’ - you’ll find loads of rhythm games across platforms for free :) EDIT: I forgot to add!! Good luck with controlling your MD!I’m working through this problem currently! I’ve found that recognising when you begin to daydream is the best way of stopping it. Tell yourself “we’re focusing on this right now, we can daydream/fantasize later,” Usually this occurs with tasks that we do a lot - find a way to draw your attention more to the games you play; listen to the sounds in-game, pay attention to what is happening on screen, etc. What game is it specifically? I ask because then it’ll be easier for me to explain how you can concentrate better at it, it’s fine if you don’t want to answer this though - but I hope it helps!I’ve experienced this. If the daydream deals with a subject matter close to home or is particularly vivid then we have a bigger tendency to feel hurt by a daydream. I think a good technique to limiting this specific daydream is to take notice of when you feel yourself fantasising it, and remind yourself this is an unhelpful thing to think about. Especially if it’s making your depression worse. EDIT: Forgot to add, it’s absolutely normal to come up with scenarios where we feel upset or hurt. I think as human beings, we sometimes like to feel sad simply for the feeling. I think Imogen Heap said it best when she sang, “There’s beauty in the breakdown”. Just make sure that you can control this specific feeling especially with your depression.I use to deal with this a lot before, and I'm really not a professional but I hope you can find some help through my advice. When you're met with comments that are directly offending you a good technique is identifying first why these comments are making you feel this way. Ask yourself: Why do I allow myself to listen to these things that make me upset or angry? Why am I so angry in the first place? A lot of the time, people say the things you mention to elicit a reaction of either anger or sadness, they're purposefully written to shut up whoever they argue with. When you're able to ignore these comments, or take them without being offended, this 'smug' demeanor people have towards you suddenly means zilch as they realise it's not working against you, and they themselves look like the 'loser' that they try to paint you as. I think the main issue here is what you already mentioned - problems of self esteem. When i dealt with self-esteem issues I found that anything said to me was a personal attack - it's easy to feel this way when we feel we're not good enough. When you come to understand that you are a person who is deserving of respect not only from others but from yourself you'll begin to find that you can take insults way better. You're thinking goes from, \"I am such a stupid person, I deserve to die, they're pushing me down for a reason\" to, \"They're so stupid, thinking their comments would deter me, they won't get me down\". When someone simply replies with a derogatory message, **NOT replying at all works best.** However, you would be surprised how riled up these people get when you reply to their inflammatory messages with simply an 'Ok.' and then leaving the convo for good. Other than that, I think taking a break from political discussions is a good step. Come back to it when you feel stronger! You'll come to understand these people aren't worth discussing with when they can't articulate a proper argument and have to resort to insults. Hope this helps!Chemical World by Blur always comes to mind - a song about a girl who lives in her own fantasies (among other things); before I knew about MD I related to it a lot. Now that I know about MD I can understand why... \"Well I don't know about you/But they're putting the holes in/Until you can see right through\" 'Putting the holes in' meant something about drugs? But I always thought it sounded more like 'poking holes through your fantasies until 'you can see right through' them into real life'...Yeah, even reading my post back in my head it sounds weird. It just sucks. I don't want someone her age to think I'm cute or want to meet me. It's just uncomfortable and weird. I wish I was meeting someone my age. This concert's gonna suck. Also, sorry, I'm bad at explaining. I guess the reason I feel this way is because of trauma I experienced as a child. I guess I become obsessed with age because I'm really freaked out about hurting someone more vulnerable than I am. Idk, I'm not too sure myself. (I'm not really interested in sex anyway)I struggle with this too. I've done terrible things to the people I loved as a kid and as a teen. It makes me feel like I am inherently a bad person since ive done shitty things since I was young. Even during certain mental fits I feel like a demon that was sent to Earth to make others suffer. It's hard, damn near impossible for me to forgive myself, and I dont think I ever will. I'm sorry you're struggling with this, too. But i can say that the fact that you feel remorse for what youve done shows youre a good person.Found this explanation for Oceanographer's Choice by TheFlatWorm from songmeanings.com \"Stab at the title. I'd say for a start that it probably refers to Hobson's Choice. An apparently free choice where only one option is really offered. That is to say, the protagonist is drawn to the subject of the song, and although s/he could choose not to pursue the relationship, really s/he has no choice. I'd suggest that the 'Oceanographer' refers to the tempestuous nature of the relationship, emotions like waves that come and go almost of their own volition, driven by incredibly powerful undercurrents. Things both deeply burried and invisible to the naked eye. Thus, one who studies the flow of oceans is analogous with one who studies human passions. So, it's the attempt to understand the reasons why you love someone who is bad for you, and knowing that even if you could understand, you are powerless to resist.\" Source: https://songmeanings.com/m/songs/view/3530822107858492929/Be very patient. Wait until she feels comfortable to talk about her trauma. If she never decides to talk about it, don't push it and don't take it personally. Ask her about her triggers so you can make an effort to avoid triggering her in the future. If you do trigger her on accident, don't take it personally. Sometimes the smallest things can trigger someone with PTSD. Also, while she does have a mental illness, she should not be allowed to make you feel bad for anything that happens. Try to establish clear boundaries of what is acceptable. And if she starts acting shitty to you and hides behind the \"mental illness\" card, don't be afraid to stand up for yourself.For me, I used hydrogen peroxide and cotton swabs to clean out the cuts in the early stages. Applying once every night to clean it out and then band aids or surgical tape to keep the cuts closed. If you dont keep them closed, the scar will be bigger and take longer to heal. Then once the cut scabs, DO NOT pick at it. This will only make the scar worse and take longer to heal. Then use small amounts of either petroleum jelly or aloe vera to keep the area moisturized. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Self-Harm-Scars%3famp=1 Once the scar is fully healed, use Shea Butter or Bio oil if you want them to fade more. Theres plenty of oils out there to make scars fade. Hope this helps.In bmbmbm, everyone looks at Morgan to cue the 3 + 4 beat before beginning the breakdown on the downbeat of 1. In Ducter, I've found that either Matt or Greep will fall onto one foot after the first breakdown to signal the stop. In 953, as well as the leg kick, everyone looks at Morgan again to begin the fast section. ALSO, in the fast breakdown of 953, Morgan isnt following a beat until the song slows down long enough to hear one. You can sometimes see Geordie slowly moving his head to the beat, which Morgan picks up on and starts playing to. In Near Dt, Mi, the first 2 notes that Matt plays is meant to lay down a beat so everyone can come in together on the 3rd beat. So, I guess that's a cue. In Talking Heads, Cameron plays this little lick during the drum breakdown, combined with a beat from Morgan that cues the 2nd verse. I cant think of any other ones. Which is a testament to the chemistry these guys have. Sometimes they dont need cues because theyre so damn synchronized.I really appreciate all the suggestions. But I'm really not in any position to be buying more pets, haha. I don't have the money (a puppy is already enough money), and my parents wouldn't approve. I also don't have friends. I'm really quiet and to myself. I also don't believe in any religious deity sadly. I don't mean to shoot down all your help, but I'm just as stubborn as my parents. Although, I will try to keep repeating the mantra to myself that the worst of it is over. I do know that some parts of me still believe it hasn't ended and will never end. So that may help.I feel like trying to classify what you're experiencing is a bit inconsequential. It's clear that what you're going through is hurting you and causing you a great distress. Whether that it is PTSD or not is reason for concern, and would also be reason to talk to a therapist or a doctor. But trying to put labels on things can make stuff more confusing. I would just recommend seeing a therapist about this, as only they would have the expertise to know. And also, putting your feelings aside and neglecting your own well-being could hurt you and your daughter in the long term.All those dragons have a bunch of things going for them, but some folk just aren’t into those extra details. The same people who like Hydreigon, for instance, might not be the same people who like Kingdra, if that makes sense. Charizard meanwhile, in its simplicity, gets the message across enough for folks to go “Aw HELL YEAH, a DRAGON!” without going in too deep. Plus, it’s a starter. That adds an extra notch of attachment in addition to being easier to find/evolve compared to the other dragon types.Alright, I’ll bite. Amphibia being a silly show is fine. Not every episode needs to be True Colors. The girls getting more focus than the Plantars wouldn’t be a good idea in the long term. I keep seeing people say “they should just focus on the girls instead of the frogs” but I honestly think that’d be a bad idea and would take away from Anne’s dynamic with the Plantars introducing her to more healthy relationships. They’re important for her development. If the show focused solely on the girls, it wouldn’t suddenly fix the writing issues. I love Sasha and Marcy, but I wouldn’t trade our current episodes for them. At least until we see how the finale pans out. Season 2B was pretty good until the finale skyrocketed it even further. Let’s just wait and see how Season 3B wraps up instead of denouncing it as the worst one. I wish they did more with the Hop Pop rebellion mention in the S1 finale. The Shipping is fine. It’s harmless, I don’t see any reason to murder anyone who has any ships to begin with. That said, I feel we probably won’t get any romance in the show between the three girls. But hey. No harm in others having their preferences. Gamer Andrias is the best thing ever.Yeah, I’m more worried than anything else. I’m trying to be optimistic, but the first trailer felt way more like “Skull Island 2: Godzilla Attacks”. And it’s a real bummer how they’re just unabashedly treating Godzilla like the antagonist with him being the one taking the most hits. Real tired of the whole “Mammal good, Reptile evil” trope. I’m hoping the movie completely subverts my expectations and has Godzilla win out. Considering MechaG might show up, it’d make sense for Godzilla to beat Kong, MG shows up to force a 1v1 with a weakened Godzilla, and Kong to pull a surprise help at the last moment. As it is though, I got a bad hunch.It’s a fair set up. Kudos to the MH knowledge here btw. The hunters can keep their durability up while maintaining some good strategies. But I’m not sure I can buy them winning still. Ghidorah in the MV has three heads to survey for trouble. That makes strategy making hard considering the ranged moves he has already. He’s cunning, so it’s not likely they’ll lure him in without having any ORCA to work off of. What’s stopping him from destroying the arena around? Or from flying off to heal as he sees fit or to find a power source? Sure, there are none in the vicinity, but nothing is stopping Ghidorah from retreating. I still stand by the fact that I can’t see the Hunters landing enough damage on his wings to ground him, so I’m not gonna repeat that whole point. That and there’s a chance Ghidorah will choose to stay airborne, which now it’s a matter of hoping the airships can do their job, although I doubt they’ll take that damage well considering Ghids was able to handle an entire fleet in D.C with no struggle. Second problem is that Ghidorah, being an alpha, can still call in for back up. The only ones that won’t respond to his call are Godzilla, Mothra, and Kong. But for all intents and purposes, while Ghidorah is alpha, this whole strategy can fall apart. In KOTM, once Godzilla was gaining the upper hand with Mothra, Ghidorah called in Rodan to deal with her proper, and was able to let out a call to the other Titans across the planet. Assuming the hunters have yet to hunt any of the Titans, that’s bad news immediately. Rodan by sheer flight alone can level a whole city, so that’s going to be a huge issue for the hunters if back up arrives. Thirdly, this still runs under all the same problems of the former issues I brought up. It took many nuclear pulses to keep Ghidorah down, and even as a head, he was still alive enough to cry out. I struggle to see how the weaponry of the four hunters can keep him down, especially when put to scale with everything else he survived. Even with electricity resistance, there’s still enough force behind to disintegrate those caught in the blast as seen by the countless victims of his attacks. I’ve said my piece on airships, and I don’t think they’ll provide enough help to win out. The binders are dealt with through two big points. One, Ghids has more than one head and is smart enough to free himself of similar issues before. Two, the younger Kong in Skull island was easily capable of freeing himself from a similar bind. At this point, he wasn’t as strong as Godzilla, who still needed plenty of buffs before taking on Ghidorah. So it’s not a very long term solution, nor will Ghidorah stay in place. The Hunters really need prep to stand a chance, but odds are that they’re still on shaky ground to pull through in that fight. Most of what they can dish can either be survived, or won’t do much because of the sheer size difference. For now, I’ll just consider this a big “agree to disagree” situation. I have no doubt the hunters can put up a fantastic fight, but I don’t think it’ll be enough to call it a victory. Ghidorah has millions of years of experience, and more often than not, needs the likes of Godzilla himself alongside other Titans just to keep him down. For now, I’ll just say agree to disagree. Mostly since I still don’t see a lot of good win conditions for the hunters withoutThe flying monster talk falls back to “but are they consistently landing wing shattering damage on those monsters”? That’s something that only happens after adding pressure after pressure on Ghids. Which, once again, he won’t allow. Well considering that hunters still feel damage from it, a flap of those wings will send them flying, and one could argue his gravity bolts hold different properties than just electricity... that armor ain’t holding up. Even the best armor still has to be careful of Rajang beams. You kind of do, though? Ghidorah has taken plenty of punishment on his wings, and we’re talking four hunters who he can target as he pleases. And very tiny cuts like the ones the hunters will land really won’t do enough punishment in the long term especially if the other heads pick up on this and fling them off, or he bashes them through buildings. The basis of your argument is assuming Ghidorah is going to sit there and take all the damage when we know he isn’t a sitting duck. Size isn’t the issue here. It’s size with insane durability that’s the problem. The MH giants don’t really scale as high as Godzilla’s best feats in the Monsterverse. The same Godzilla who needed to power up twice just to defeat Ghidorah. So we got one of the biggest monsters theyre fighting, mixed in with healing properties, three fields of vision to rely on, flight that can take them far beyond the hunter’s reach, and beams that disintegrate armed soldiers. Not looking so hot for them. You keep going back to prep and luck. Yes. They can prep to the best of their efforts. No, luck won’t save them here. Ghidorah is not going to give them a chance to retreat since he’s devoured smaller humans before, and there’s little way the hunters can plan for traps or weapons that are on the scale needed to hold Ghids down enough to hold solid damage. They have no good way to exploit his weaknesses beyond the elder seal, but that matters little when Ghidorah’s durability still ranks way higher than their standard fare. The most they can hope for is a retreat. But by that point, Ghidorah can just recharge and heal, and then it’s back to square one.By the aforementioned flying high? That’s a pretty clear cut advantage. And I already said why summoning other monsters or taking the fight to the sky is a terrible idea. We return to the point of the size gap. Ghidorah’s wings are way too huge to poke holes in. This is assuming the hunters get the time to climb on top, don’t get electrified in the process since his electricity travels through the body, and stab hard enough to draw damage. For a Hunter to do significant wing damage, they need to be constantly putting pressure on them. Once again, pressure that Ghidorah just won’t allow. He’s pretty aware of smaller prey and is more than happy to strike them down at every move. And the hunters aren’t always striking with wing shattering force, so when they have to deal with something on that scale, it’s not looking pretty for them, Ghidorah pretty much manhandled any fighter jet or monster that tried taking him in the sky, balloons and flying ships are gonna get torn asunder when he now has far more mobility and can control the terrain they’re fighting in. While they have hunted monsters on ships, they still have plenty of risk to worry about. They could still get flung off and damaged considerably. And those are against monsters who abide by the game physics and work under those circumstances. Ghidorah isn’t going to play by Monster Hunter rules. He could call upon other airborne kaiju to damage the fleets or tear it apart from a safe distance. This goes back to the point that challenging the airborne hydra to a fight in the sky might not be the wisest option.I feel there’s an apples and oranges comparison going on here, especially since I’m not sure how the hunters will use Fatalis’ flames in the long run, but hey. And I’m fairly sure if Ghidorah was struck once and notices the healing isnt working, I’m sure that’ll force him to be careful. It’s less hypothetical and more common sense. Opening gaps in the wings is, once again, hard. The hunters are 6 feet tall trying to damage a 600 foot tall hydra with a wingspan that makes a Gogmazios blush. Not to mention these same wings can take insane punishment and withstand the depths of space. The most the hunters could do is poke a hole in them, maybe? But to do that, they need to be constantly adding pressure onto those wings. Pressure that Ghidorah won’t let them have. Calling smaller flying kaiju won’t always work since Ghidorah is an alpha that can call upon his own allies like Rodan, so that’s troubling as is. Plus, he can fly past the atmosphere. As far as we know, no monster in the Monsterverse has cosmic origins beyond Ghids. And unless we’re applying Stories or Rise gives some good airborne monster feats, I don’t think the hunters are going to be in an advantageous spot by taking the fight to the air. If anything, that’s foolish since by that point, they’re flying into a storm on planetary proportions. And seeing as Ghidorah stomped Rodan in a midair fight, I doubt it’s gonna save the hunters much.We’re having two convos at once, to be fair lol. This one I was focusing more on the Godzillaverse as a whole rather than just MV Ghidorah. I’m not saying the MH Monsters aren’t tough. But if we’re basing off the mainline versions, most of their best feats are outdone by the Kaiju by sheer scale alone. Godzilla survived atmospheric drops, destroyed a planet busting meteor and the resulting explosion without even a scratch, and if we apply comics, has slain godlike beings. The hunters are bound to get some cuts in at the kaiju, but enough to keep them down? Maybe in Showa or ‘98. But many of the newer variants are far out there in league. The most I can see is forcing a retreat, but that’s given the best possible prep time for the hunters. In the long run, I can’t see how they’ll keep the high tier kaiju down, especially when they’re smart enough to keep pace and know when to adapt as well.But we don’t know if they have any gear that can damage the high rank monsters. That’s the problem. And considering these monsters are tanking things as small as rockets or Destoroyah microbes, or as large as meteors or black holes, I don’t see how poking them for long enough will put them down permanently. We’re forgetting that these monsters don’t operate exactly like those in the MH universe. These monsters don’t get tired as easily if at all, travel far greater distances on a daily basis, heal faster, and can shrug off most elemental effects. The best bet is the elder seal, but that doesn’t account for the fact that these monsters are still way too durable to cut a hole in and start stabbing at their organs with.Burning Godzilla melts by presence alone. It was the shockwave that actually damaged Ghidorah. He was handling Godzilla’s presence fine until the pulse, which is likely a higher and more explosive concentration, That’s assuming Ghidorah lets the elder seal strike again. Considering he’s got aerial mobility, I don’t think he’ll give them the range to land it again without pelting the hunters with gravity bolts. Also bringing in another kaiju is 50/50 depending on who it is. Godzilla is the best bet, but anything less gets toppled all the same.Charizard and the 7 Stitches. One Charizard with enough versatility in its moveset could take me far. If anything, at least for mobility and range. The Stitches... man. One by itself is OP. Super genius, insane strength, and likely access to a ship. Seven of them is an entire army in and of itself. The biggest worries for Zard are the buzzshocks and Ogres. But I think the Stitch squad will be smart and strong enough to keep them down or find a way to contain them. The rest can be swept up in flames.I don’t think Fatalis’ heat is comparable to Burning G, considering one is a powerful stream of fire and the other is many concentrated nukes powered up by a goddess. But this ain’t about that comparison rn. The Elder Seal isnt a permanent solution though since Ghidorah has multiple ways to recharge regardless. They can study his biology, but I don’t think they’ll get much out of it to take advantage of. That and I’m not sure if Ghidorah is the type to give them a chance for round two. If they can’t beat him in one round, he tends to either kill or devour smaller humans. Even with the support and gear, I don’t see the path being easy to achieve, if at all.I think this is where we lean into the hypotheticals now. There’s bound to be a weapon that can pierce the monster’s hide if they craft it out of other monster scales. But by that point, we can only assume the effectiveness without taking into account how the kaiju would respond, or if they can bounce back from. Even if there are otherworldly weapons, I return to my point that most of those weapons don’t compare to what the Godzillaverse has bounced back from. Elder seal can only work for so long if their target has the right power source to regenerate from, and the way most monsters are in Godzilla operate differently from the ones in Monster Hunter. There are few weaknesses they have, but the ones that can be exploited require work that the hunters can’t afford, or aren’t going to be known by just looking at them and how they fight. And this is assuming they’ll single out a monster and not have another one come in for support, since monsters like Godzilla have plenty of allies (Rodan, Mothra) who grant him even further power.I don’t know if they’ll be able to destoy his organs without having to deal with all kinds of punishment beforehand. This goes back to the regen argument. Tearing down his wings might be a huge issue too. The only time Ghidorah’s wings were torn asunder was when Godzilla went burning mode, which was melting buildings by sheer presence alone. And even then, he needed a nuclear pulse to be sure. Those wings are gonna take way more than what the hunters have in store. It depends on what monster. Rodan or Mothra put up a good fight, but got taken down in seconds. Godzilla can stand a better shot, but he needs a boost to keep Ghidorah down. I feel with all the prep the hunters could have, it just won’t be enough since odds are Ghidorah can bounce back from the damage and then some.I’m going with the assumption that the armor from the start is based in the MH world, while any kaiju armor needs to be formed proper. But, fair enough. Most of the buffs you mentioned though aren’t much new for the Godzilla world. Depending on what era, plenty can keep up in stamina (Final Wars Goji literally traveled around the world wrecking every monster in his wake), and most weapons and guns they could buff up still pale in comparison to what the kaiju have survived. While I think most of the Showa monsters are probably in danger by round 5, Most of the later monsters have survived far greater weaponry with barely any permanent damage. While the Hunters have taken on similar concepts, they don’t have a good way to keep the high tiers down without getting another monster to even out the damage.Theyre no strangers to all those things, but they’re up against monsters that can use all of those at once as they please. In terms of traps, that’s going to take a long while. I’m assuming the monsters aren’t scaled down, so they’ll need something huge to hold them in place as is. Siege weapons are a safer bet, although that’s assuming Ghidorah falls for it as there are three heads that can survey and strategize as well. Elder seal could solve most of their problems, though that doesn’t work around Ghidorah’s durability. Plus, he can recharge with radiation or electricity around if they’re near a power source. So the seal isn’t really an end all be all. I will say, the Wyvern Riding in Rise could give them a huge chance? That’s the most direct way to damage Ghids, I feel. Problem is luring the monsters in. They respond only to an Alpha, or the ORCA. The latter through a mix of Godzilla’s and human DNA. If the hunters can make something like that, it could aid in their fight, but now they got TWO giant monsters to deal with. Especially if it’s one of the hostile ones. There’s plenty of good material and strategy they can pull from. But they’ll need more than luck to take down Ghidorah.That’s if they get lucky enough to find that kind of material. With shattered scales, it’s not a guarantee they’ll be able to find enough to make a full set out of it. They’ll have to keep risking their lives in each Godzilla fight to hopefully stack up on materials, but that puts them too far in the line of fire, especially depending on the variants. Plus, the best case scenario for the Hunters are the later rounds, meaning we have 3 to 4 armor sets they need to farm and hope they get just enough to make a complete set with none of them getting killed in the crossfire. I don’t doubt the Hunters can put up a great fight. But I don’t think it’ll be enough to win out. Even if they find the right armor, they then have to work on bypassing the monster’s durability. And these guys are already higher than the typical raid fight in game. And even with the armor, it’s not a guarantee they can survive what the other high tiers dish out since most of them can shred through hides that are bigger and more plentiful in size compared to the smaller sets of the hunters.Mothra or MUTO armor could get them places, but I don’t think it’ll be far enough. While Mothra is tough, she struggled against Rodan and got one shot by Ghidorah. I could see them getting some armor based off the Skullcrawlers, MUTO, and maybe some of the awakened Titans from KOTM. (Hard to say if it’ll help or not since we barely saw them do much. Lets assume it lets them survive explosive weaponry and artillery for now.) Issue is, I don’t think that armor will be enough. In KOTM, Ghidorah was keeping up with a powered up Godzilla and was an even match for him until Mothra dropped in. This Godzilla already survived the Permian Extinction before the boost, so that’s already bad enough. Then, Ghidorah further boosted himself up by absorbing the electricity in the city. Assuming they’re fighting in one, that means the Hunters are in for an intense fight come phase two. While the Hunters have survived some crazy fights against Dalamadur or Zorah Magdaros, Ghidorah is still a tad too high in the food chain. With no boosts, he was giving Godzilla a run for his money, and only started losing when he took the fight to sea. Even after Burning Godzilla came into play, he was tanking multiple pulses until finally being put down. We don’t fully know what kind of armor abilities or perks they’ll get from the other Titans, so with all that said, they’ll need a really lucky round 5 to stand a chance. And even with that, I can’t see them winning by any chance.I think stacking up potential armor from previous monsters can give them some leverage? But I don’t think it’s enough. Say they put down Mothra and make armor out of her. That could let them stand a chance against, say, Anguirus or Rodan. But it’s not a guarantee’d unless we apply Rounds 4 or 5. Especially since those monsters can still take heaps of punishment too, from arguably more dangerous monsters. Giving them Elder dragon weapons could help them I feel. Enough to take on the big guys? I’m... still not so sure. I have trouble imagining any Godzilla that can survive black holes or Absolute Zero cannons to fall so easy, let alone the fact that most of those versions have a healing factor. When you mix the fact that these monsters have plenty of durability to match their firepower, I can’t see a good way the hunters can keep any of them down without having to use armor from previous monsters. And even then, that isn’t foolproof since some low tiers get one shot by the high tiers. So getting armor from Baragon or Mothra can only take them so far.I got my doubts they can take on Ghidorah. Dalamadur, at the end of the day, doesn’t really stack up well to the high tiers of the Godzilla world considering these are the same monsters that have tanked nuclear weaponry without a scratch. Plus, Monsterverse Ghidorah can heal, fly far beyond their reach, and is way more durable than the typical Dalamadur. To summarize, it’s 3 Dalamadur, capable of flight and regeneration, and was able to survive multiple nuclear pulses before being put down. The Hunters being able to put that down is kind of wishful thinking.Being generous? I could see monsters like Kong, Baragon, and Kumonga being standard fare. Most of the island dwelling kaiju in general should fit right at home, albeit it might need round 5 to win out for some. Any of the high tiers? ... Yeeaah, no. Yes. The hunters face elder dragons like Dalamadur, but Godzilla and the other high tiers of his world kind of clap Dalamadur easy. We’re dealing with Titans that can survive black holes, high tech weaponry, and have wiped out planets many times prior. Not to mention some are way smarter than we give credit for. We could argue “But Hunters scale to planet level Fatalis!” but I’m not sure I buy that. But, if we play ball and apply it, it’s STILL not enough. The high tier kaiju still have way higher destructive range, and if we apply certain variations, have survived so much more than any hunter could give out. Only made worse when you remember many of them have healing properties, so the damage the Hunters dish could be completely undone. To make a long story short, the Hunters should prolly stick to Monster or Skull island. Any of the higher tier monsters are way out of their pay grade. EDIT: This is also without taking into account of the Comic versions of the monsters. Considering how ridiculous IDW!verse Godzilla is, I doubt any Hunter will be getting far enough.I wish there were a middle ground option. Season 7s highs are really damn solid. Machamp Vs. Goro is one of my fave episodes because of this, and stuff like Beerus Vs. Galaxia, Miles Vs. Static, and Danny Vs. Jake were satisfying to watch. But this season suffers a ton from variety. Way too many comic book fights are popping out, and they feel obvious as could be. DC has been on an annoying win streak, and most unique match ups are being shafted in favor of the Marvel/DC choices. I just hope Season 8 learns from these critiques and spaces out all the matches a bit more proper this time.It’s a mix of a couple things. - The fact that they go on a winning streak before going out - Some of those fights they win are against beloved characters with big fanbases who people want to see win (Archie Sonic, Ben 10) - This season has been WAAAAY too over abundant with DC characters DC wins weren’t an issue for me in Season 5 or 6. But man, the constant winning gets repetitive and makes it hard to enjoy. Season 7 being so trigger happy with the DC reps has only made it worse. I don’t even hate DC, I’m just sick of seeing them win so often and think they need a cosmic match that can humble them a bit. But seeing as how even the strongest of characters can’t beat them... Yeah. Guess we just gotta hope Simon Vs. Kyle happens at some point?Tbh most of the Boys characters dying was satisfying af, barring Maeve and Starlight since they’re still likable. Only wish Homelander got yeeted too. Satisfying depends on personal stuff I guess, because by itself, I don’t really hate most characters? But it’s usually a background issue. Galaxia’s death was satisfying because everyone and their mother said Beerus was doomed against her, so seeing her get destroyed was fun. Goro’s death was also satisfying since most of the cocky MK fans were expecting Goro to wash over the fight.Aight. So... here’s my take, I guess. I really don’t like The Boys. Even though the show is an improvement to the comics, I still think it’s just edgy schlock that’s only as popular as it is because of Superhero burnout. But hey. I can push that aside if the episode holds up decently enough. DB tends to have fun with their material, so why not? Well. I gotta say this is the weakest Battle Royale episode so far. I mean, hey. I’m glad it’s a sponsor episode so it’s not eating up a slot. But man, it really is just “watch The Boys” the episode, huh? Idk. I’m super biased against the series, but this episode was a hard meh. It wasn’t WWvSheRa bad, but that’s not saying much. ~~Plus, hey, at least Butcher died. Now if only we could strike down the remaining characters...~~I’m liking what I see so far! Pros: - Crash’s movement looks super enjoyable, yet still challenging all the same. - This is all one level, right? It’s longer than I thought it would be, so we’re definitely in for a ride. - The puzzles and secrets are well placed and require a keen eye. I barely even noticed the boxes in the waterfall. Cons: - Slide Jump. Still looks real nerfed, but I’ll probably adjust to it in game. - I prefer Aku Aku hovering by Crash. The shield thing just... really bugs me. Hoping it lives up to hype!Hey, I wrote that Red/Zard fight when I was younger. :b My analysis skills have improved since then. ~~Though I also buffed up Rathalos to hell and back by giving him Stories content but hey~~ Eh. I don’t think Glavenus connects that well to Charizard. Flaming tails aside, if the main thing connecting them is “favoritism”, it probably doesn’t have much to work aside. Plus, going by that argument, Rathalos has been getting exclusive content for even longer than Glav has. And unlike Glavenus, has the flight and speed needed to keep pace with Charizard, and the solid connections of being a Gen 1 Fire Dragon who have dominated the skies for many years, and are an icon of their respective series. You can disagree all you want, but if a monster is weak to a dragon esque element, and the other can release the same kind of element... They’re gonna get hurt by said element. Even ignoring that it’s still the same properties so it’s bound to be super effective, Zard also has access to Dragon Breath, which can paralyze opponents and further increase its speed gap against whoever it’s foe is.I got a list. Kirby - Kirby would be fun to see proper again. Ben seems to be iffy on his match with Buu (though it’s accurate) so maybe reanalyzing Kirby could be fun. Against who? I’m... not too sure actually. Godzilla - Yes, he got his ideal match with Gamera. But animation wise, HOO Big G could use a touch up. There’s so much more Godzilla content we’ve gotten since his first fight too, so I welcome a new battle. Against who? Maybe Groudon, I see that requested often. Or an Eva Unit. I’d say rematch with Gamera, but tbh Gamera hasn’t gotten content since last match. So it’ll be a hard stomp. Charizard - “But he already fought in the Royale! And against Greymon!” Yeah, and I want him to not be in a match he’s screwed in. This is probably my INSANE bias for Charizard Vs. Rathalos as a match, but I wanna see Charizard get one more chance to prove itself, modern analysis and all. ~~I mean it would be better than bringing back WW for a third time soooo~~ Yoshi - While he wrecked Riptor, I think Yoshi could use a proper match to show how insane the Mario world gets. Plus, New Island is chock full of Yoshi feats. You can probably pit him against Tails since it’ll probably satiate the people who want Luigi Vs. Tails 2.Most of Batman’s greatest accomplishments can be chalked up to prep time, or exploiting enemy weaknesses. The problem with pitting him against Spidey is that there’s no clear outright way for Bats to overwhelm him without outside equipment. The Spider sense will generally keep Peter out of danger, especially since he can match Bruce’s speed and then some, and his strength by itself is insane to overcome. Add in the fact that this isn’t Spidey’s first fight with a billionaire with tech access, and it becomes clear that Bats can’t really stack up.With the test failing though, the way she reacted during and afterwards? I dunno. That seemed like genuine panic as she was trying to escape the onslaught. Not to mention genuine sadness when she failed. Most of this could be chalked up to “She was acting”, I’m sure. But I just don’t buy it. We either assume she knew exactly which professor she’d be up against and how to act surprised and fail intentionally, or we roll with the more realistic answer, which is coincidence. There’s a chance she could be the traitor, I won’t doubt it. But since she’s my favorite character... um, I’m hoping she isn’t!Charizard Vs. Greymon - Red realizes Agumon has a tamer and instead asks for a chill battle where the two learn from each other. Miles Vs. Static - Miles: WHOA! Watch it! I got places to be tomorrow! Static: For real? You attacked ME! Miles: Look, that was my bad! There’s another electric guy causing trouble out there and I got mixed up! Static: Mixed up? How many electric guys are there out there? Miles: No clue. But we aren’t gonna get far by zapping each other to death. Come on! *he swings off* Static: Hey, zapping is kinda my thing! *he chases after* Cue fun crossover shenanigans. Danny Vs. Jake - Jake: Yo! Back to steal something else? *cue dragon up* Danny: Uh, funny story, I was actually returning this from some thugs and- Wait, you’re a dragon? Jake: Um. Yeah...? Danny: Guess that makes us even! I’m going ghost! *cue going ghost* Jake: Whooaa, a ghost kid! So that’s what all the fuss was about! Danny: I could use some help too. There are some other relics that I’m still trying to find out there. Jake: Say no more, G’! I think we got this! Cue childhood satisfying crossoverCharizard Vs. Greymon - As Charizard is in a near death spot, Red drops the rest of his Pokéballs, releasing his main team to suppress WarGreymon. Seeing the opportunity, he gives Charizard one last command. A final Blast Burn to end the fight. With that one move, Greymon and Tai are swept up in the blast, earning a narrow win. Pikachu Vs. Blanka - Instead of the collision, Blanka seems to have Pikachu in a full combo, about to kill the yellow mouse Pokémon. However, Pikachu’s ability kicks in, paralyzing Blanka. With him being left vulnerable, Pikachu finishes the fight with a high speed Volt Tackle, resulting in green limbs flying everywhere. Bowser Vs. Ganon - Literally any ending where Bowser wins. Idk how, just something cool lmao. Miles Vs. Static/Danny Vs. Jake - The fight goes the same way and the results don’t have to change. Just that the winner doesn’t kill the loser and just kinda have some fun banter after defeating their opponent. Happy endings are nice.Overrated: Ben Vs. Green Lantern. I know this episode is divisive, but I always felt it was a hard “meh”. I’m not disagreeing with the results by any means, but the amount of “haha look at the salty Ben fan” jokes really soured me on this episode. The animation isn’t as great as the rest of the season, the way GL could have dispatched of Ben could have been done better, and they could have done extra justice to both sides in the long run. At least the music was S tier. Underrated: Dragonzord Vs. MechaGodzilla. This fight was honestly one of my favorite fights, only rivaled by Goro Vs. Machamp. Every hit in the fight felt like it had impact, both sides were done so much justice, and there were some scenes that got me so hype originally. Like the Berserk Kiryu takeover and the Power Rangers riff during the transformation. Don’t even get me started on that fake out. I’m super biased (username checks out, I’m aware lmao) but this episode feels like the Kaiju fight Death Battle I’ve been craving since Season 2.Charizard Vs. Rathalos - The 1st Gen signature dragons of both Pokémon and Monster Hunter, who have been available generation across generation. They’ve mastered both flight and flame, and are the ultimate monsters to do so. - Monster Hunter is becoming more popular with Worlds, and is pretty much Capcom’s best seller. I don’t even need to begin with Pokémon’s success, so both franchises handle popularity well. - 3D Fight fits best. Rathalos has plenty of models to go off of, as does Charizard. - While unlikely, this gives an opportunity to analyze G-Max Charizard to justify its appearance for a third time. Add Dreadking Rath to balance it out. - The styles between the two should mesh well enough. A more high flying and dynamic Charizard pulling off some crazy moves against the more durable and fierce Rathalos. Focus on a colorful fight. - Let the music have an awesome mix of Red’s battle theme, and Rathalos’ themes across the games.I’d personally put them in a similar ballpark. In the Goro Vs. Machamp Q&A, the reason they discounted Dual Chop was because Goro has shown no weakness towards dragon-esque moves like that. Glavenus meanwhile, has shown vulnerability against Dragon Element attacks. While the two versions look different, if we consider their fire moves act similarly, the same should be done for their dragon element moves. Plus, other than visually, there’s nothing that suggests the two are vastly different in their properties.Ugh, it’s the worst when people try to dictate what to do with your characters. I had one time I was looking forward to using a certain character who happened to be a single mother of many. My partner just outright refused midway through RP and wanted me to retcon out the kids and turn the mother into this more aggressive/kinky(???) person. Pretty shitty situation. It really sucks when bad RPs just sour you on going back into the fray. I’d say to not let it get to you, but I can’t force you to do something that makes you unhappy. I’m glad you got out of that mess before it got worse though. It sounds like a crappy situation all around.I like to imagine some Sauropods got away from the massacre (Don’t take this from me I’m still coping) But... HOLY CRAP THAT WAS BRUTAL. Honestly, one of the most creepy episodes so far. Seeing a sauropod, something so massive yet peaceful, turn into a bloodlusted zombie is so chilling to me. Like seeing a lovable pet dog get rabies or something. It’s depressingly scary in that light. I think this is the first time Spear and Fang didn’t bother to fight their way out of a problem. They just ran for the entire episode, and shoot, I don’t blame them. Even they got limits on what they can fight. The Sauropod’s death was pretty sad too. You’d think it’d be relieving, but this poor thing was just suffering all the way through. It’s absolutely brutal.The Boys is one of those series that I’ve always had a sour spot for. There’s clever ways to delve into and deconstruct heroes, but it just goes for the easy options or the shock value. There’s only two or three characters I can actually root for, and the world is painted in such a “literally every hero is crappy and evil lol” that I just can’t invest in it. It’s even worse in the comics. I’m prolly in the minority, but I can’t get invested in the premise. I like the idea of focusing on the Seven and other heroes, maybe showing more complex decision making for them as they fight the status quo. It’d be more interesting than “discount Punisher does the bloody thing”Oh, it’s fine, and I perfectly get where you’re coming from. It still feels weird to only have one member of the trio go solo. That being said, this Charizard push has been a thing for a while now. It’s practically with Pikachu, Eevee, and Lucario as the Pokémon that get the biggest push in marketing. It’s kind of inevitable that they’ll give it this kind of attention compared to the others. Plus, this isn’t even the first time one starter took precedence over the other two. Mega Blaziken happened before ORAS, Ash-Greninja, etc. I do hope that in a third version, they let Bulbasaur and Squirtle return. I still stand by the hate feels overblown, but that doesn’t mean it should come at the cost of the other starters.Today, in Pokémon fan base overreacting... Charizard is officially Satan because it showed up again. Man, idc if this gets downvoted to hell, but we got entire hate mob on this one Pokémon for the dumbest reason. Everyone is having this universal freak out when I’m pretty damn certain Gamefreak has been setting up Charizard as a major player on its own for the past few years with all the appearances it’s made. I stand by this; The hate for Charizard is more vocal than the actual fans. This only proves it further. Before anyone asks; While Charizard is my favorite Pokémon, I’m still bummed that Blastoise and Venusaur aren’t with it. I understand why people are upset. I just think the literal walls of text of why Charizard should be wiped from existence is silly af.I’m conflicted. On one hand, Fang being dead can easily be showing how cruel and ruthless the world is, and that anyone can die at any time. But... the series going on sounds kind of boring to be honest. If Spear just heads on with some other animal partner or a random caveman, it wouldn’t carry the same weight since it just makes the partner seem interchangeable. If Fang is destined to die, let it be the finale. We’re already attached to Fang and how her bond ties with Spear. A new partner wouldn’t carry that same kind of emotional weight I feel.There was one time I was messing with a friend over a game. Usually he takes it in stride, but I think the joke kinda went too far and he was legit upset for the rest of the day. By the time I realized I was the asshole, oof, I felt awful. Just the sinking realization that I probably ruined a good friend’s day honestly made me feel like utter crap. I don’t remember how many times I apologized to him after that. XD Luckily, it’s been years and we’re still best buds. So hey. Glad that was a minor situation that blew over quick.I’m conflicted to say the least. On one hand, yeah, I get it. Disney is getting enough of a monopoly, “be happy that they aren’t getting their greedy hands further”, etc etc. But like... it’s at the cost of my favorite superhero? And is only made worse by the fact that there’s an unresolved cliffhanger? I have a right to at least feel upset on that regard, because holy shit it sucks. “But Sony will have it in better hands! Spider-Verse and the Raimi trilogy prove-“ Spider-Verse was, and still is, my favorite movie of all time. That being said, it had the gift of Lord and Miller, with very little involvement from Sony higher ups. And the Raimi trilogy... gonna be honest, I’m not the biggest fan of it. Yes, Spider-Man 2 was great. But it never felt like the definitive Spider-Man movie for me. Also it doesn’t help that Sony’s last great live action Spidey was 10 years ago. They aren’t going to suddenly have the magic touch. Who do I side on this issue? Nobody. Sony is being dumb by not trying to at least provide a counter offer or sorting things out, but Disney is being dumb by jumping from 5% to 50% and getting greedy. Nobody wins here. Look. I really don’t want to see yet another Spider-Man reboot. Especially if it comes at the cost of Tom Holland, who’s been an absolute delight in the MCU. I was looking forward to Spidey becoming the new lead after Tony Stark’s sacrifice. Now this just feels hollow. I seriously need some optimism about this. This has just been a huge downer and makes it hard to be enthusiastic about future sequels in both the MCU, and Sony’s universeAgree to disagree? But MCU Spidey isn’t “an insult” to the character’s legacy. It’s a different take of the character who has to grow up in a world that’s full of heroes. I’m sure if we had Spidey set from the start of Phase 1, then we would have gotten a more grounded Spider-Man. But as is, this is a fine take on Peter Parker. He’s still growing up and trying to become his best self. And now that Tony Stark sacrificed himself, odds are a third Spider-Man movie is gonna center heavily around personal conflicts, especially after the post credits of FFH. Hot take? But people gotta chill about MCU!Spidey. Is he the best possible take on the character? No, there’s tons of things I think they could fix with his character arc. But is he an insult to everything Marvel has created? No. Not by a long shot. It’s just a different take on the character. It ain’t gonna kill decades of content.Oh thank god, DC’s winning streak is over (for now). While I liked the Aquaman Vs. Namor and Shazam Vs. Captain Marvel fights, the wins were starting to get excessive by Ben 10 Vs. Green Lantern Also the next fight... hooo boy I don’t know why, but I got a bad feeling they’re gonna do MG dirty. Looks like they’re sticking with Kiryu, and I’m absolutely rooting for him, but... idk. Power Rangers already lost twice and I got a tinfoil hat bad feeling that Dragonzord is gonna win by some obscure reason. Still, rooting for my boi (mech??) MechaGodzilla. Hopefully a solid Absolute Zero Cannon blast can close the fight for good.“Please stop responding.” Technically not a text (it was on another website) but when we broke up, it wasn’t on the best terms. She was kinda weird, I was kinda weird, you do stupid crap when you’re young teens. She kept getting annoying and gave me super mixed signals whether she wanted to be together or not. We tried to still be friends but it didn’t work. I just didn’t want anything to do with her anymore. So I just cut things off. Kinda wish I handled it better and on good terms, but we can’t turn back time.Okay! This movie was pretty rad! Pros: - Peter is still an absolute bean. Still my favorite iteration of the character, and it’s good to see how he’s handling the changes since “the blip”. - Mysterio is such a jerk I wanna punch him - I’m pretty much sold on MJ. She’s a total nerd and I love her dynamic with Peter. - Holy crap, the action got improved to hell and back. Same with the comedy. They really went all out here. - J.K SIMMONSSSSSS Cons: - I feel there wasn’t as much big emotional scenes? Nothing on par with the “Come on Spider-Man” scene I feel. A minor nitpick but hey. All things considered? A solid MCU entry. 9/10 for me. Hoping there’s tons planned for Spidey in the futureMinecraft Steve Look, I get it. Minecraft is a huge hit in gaming and it’s left a huge impact to many, but... I just think Steve as a character(?) is a huge no-no when it comes to smash. Janky animations, an unpleasant design. I was mostly “meh” about him, but seeing the Grotesque Steve-posters only worsened my opinion (I know not all Steve fans are like that, but still. Left a sour taste in my mouth.) I would literally take any character above Steve. Smash has so many vibrant and clean characters who animate so nicely. I’d rather see another character with fun animations and personality instead of Mr. Bland-and-BlockyThere’s two that I remember in particular. There was Ty: The Tasmanian Tiger, who had one commercial where you would see three hospital beds with Crash, Spyro, and Sonic all in full body casts after apparently fighting Ty. And then there was this other game which I legit don’t remember, but it had a Mario Kart wannabe character look out and see this GRITTY REALISTIC RACING GAME that he wanted to do. Another character told him “But racing is about making friends!” before getting punched in the stomach... even though I’ve never seen anything tear apart a friendship faster than Mario Kart. XD In the case of Ty, it was popular enough to spawn sequels, but never really got as popular as the characters they jabbed. And the fact that not a lot of people even remember that gritty racing game is proof enough it didn’t stand well.I mean... at this point I’m exhausted seeing the same posts, but if I had to add my input. Heidi’s anger in some of those posts were justified. Shit, if my girlfriend was cheating on me behind my back, i’d be pretty upset too. Reacting that way about their DnD show... can’t justify that one too much. But again, it looks more like built up anger releasing more than anything. This does dirty the waters a bit, but I still stand by Holly and Jared fucked up. Heidi might not be as clean here, but I don’t think she’s the big issue in all this.Two. - Pokemon Mystery Dungeon spin off that changes gameplay to let you go through beautiful environments with a gripping story while you get to play as whatever Pokémon you choose for yourself and the partner. More open world/action based, essentially. - Monster Hunter game where you play as the monsters. It can be a fighter, it can be a more realistic game about becoming the king of your turf, anything is fine. (I don’t count Stories since that was still mostly the Rider and not the monster)Fans: BUT I DIDN’T WANT PISTACHIO! Grumps: Then why did you ask for it?!? Tbh I get that “oh not every fan thinks the same” but no matter what, the vocal side always tends to be the one screaming about the new content. I get it. The Grumps aren’t perfect and will never be perfect. That’s being human. It’s fine. But everyone and their mother still end up crucifying them over dumb crap that’s really unnecessary. The recent Dan “controversy” is a huge example. This fandom is preeetty damn toxic. Even if the positive fans want to speak out, the toxic ones tend to just label them as shills or whatever because “how dare anyone defend the content creators they support?” It’s just tiring, man. Nobody is saying they’re perfect, but you can’t keep attacking them for stupid bs like “he said a mean thing on twitter >:(“- We should have seen Bruce’s arc to become Professor Hulk. He didn’t really get much content and was mostly a passing joke. I still like him! Just think he could have benefited from the development. - Give Nat a funeral you cowards - I get why they used Past!Thanos, but it would have been more fun to see the current Thanos with his development go through the struggle of maintaining his peace. To be fair though, I don’t think we could have gotten the climax we had with Modern!Thanos. - I would have immensely preferred if Tony survived and got to retire with Pepper and Morgan. Though to be honest, with how it was executed in the movie, I can live with how things went down. Idk, I don’t have too many criticisms, and most of the ones I do have are super nit picky.That’s the big issue with me. I really don’t want them to kill off Tony. It’s like a guy who’s done everything he could to overcome PTSD and his trauma can’t just get a break at the end. You don’t need death to tell a compelling story, and if Tony never got to marry or have a kid, he never truly completed his arc. He just... did another sacrifice like the last few he’s done and that’s it. That being said, I’m trying to keep my hopes low. From all the leaks, a lot aren’t so peachy about Tony’s fate. I’m hoping those leaks are fake, but... I don’t know. I got a bad hunch.Tony is a huge issue, but he’s not the only problem with this ending, I’ve been trying to be positive and keep an open mind, but... man, this sounds so disappointing. - Tony dies and doesn’t get to finally be free from his fears. I get that it’s likely he’ll die regardless, but I’m seriously not digging it. I want to trust the Russos, but I’m concerned they’ll kick Tony through the ground more instead of letting him have a happy ending. - Cap going back to Peggy. Maybe under the right circumstances, I could gloss over this. But this just has so many issues that everyone has already complained about, so I’m not gonna bother. - Rocket and Groot just up and leave the Guardians to hang with Thor. I get their interaction was a highlight but... really?? The two most popular Guardians just ditch the series to be dropped in Thor 4, even though Thor’s supporting cast is more than enough to hold on out?? - T’Challa doesn’t even get a second movie in his trilogy and he just tosses the mantle to Shuri. There is zero build up for this, so... why?? - Scarlet Witch turning into a villain/anti hero right before her Disney+ series. Man, we already saw evil Wanda, can we actually stick to her character growth? I really hope the Russo Bros don’t mess this up. They aren’t Rian Johnson, they know this material and can pull off story telling well. But the concern now is if THIS is the slip up. If it is... Well. I’ll only focus on the movies pre-Endgame. It’s not like the future movies would be any better. Spider-Man looks fun so far, but GOTG without Gamora, Rocket, and Groot sounds blegh. Black Panther 2 forcing Shuri into the spotlight when she was perfectly fine before sounds bad. The new IPs don’t even have me that impressed. The only reason I’ll go back is if we get Fantastic Four or something. But until then... this sounds pretty grossRight?? If they were just going to kill him off, why did they have to get everyone’s hopes up about his marriage and family if they’re just going to kill him off? That’s shit pay off for following him for 10 years on his journey. There’s nothing cathartic about this ending, it just sounds like a giant middle finger to the people who have been following Tony and his struggles. Can’t he just lose his left arm or something? Is death *that* necessary for him? I get the Russos are Team Cap, but why should Tony have to pay the price in these movies? Didn’t he suffer enough in Infinity War?Oof... Yeah those aren’t positive vibes... I’m keeping some hope that it still has the vibes of a new beginning. Ant-Man wasn’t dealing with the consequences of Sokovia, and this was a recent development. Being SUPER hopeful, Happy saying “You’re all alone” is more about “Tony can’t keep coming to save your tail every time something goes wrong.” No matter what, the movie is gonna show a post Endgame world, so spoilers be damned. Trust me, I need some optimism here too. But I’m clinging onto that last hope so far.I get Cap surviving. Tbh I’ll be happiest if everyone survives, but whatevs. Tony sacrificing himself... I don’t know? Like, I get it, but it still feels like a pretty upsetting end to the character’s arc. Going by how you laid it out, it’d be more fitting if this was the moment where his efforts paid off to reach that retirement. He plays a pivotal spot in trying to beat Thanos, and for once, everything comes full circle. Then again... I’m not sure. I feel kind of defeated when it comes to Tony’s chances at survival right now. I really want him to live, but... eh. Odds are looking grim.- I understand that, but... still. Tons of people got their hopes that after all this build up, Tony would get to finally settle down. Leaving a legacy can still be good, obviously. But it just feels disappointing. - Fair enough. Still not to keen on it, but hey. - Didn’t she do reshoots for 8 months though? I might be wrong on that though. - Agree to disagree then. - Fair point. - Ehhhh. It’s hard to argue some of these points because we need the context of the movie. Maybe it can make these points flow together better? I dunno. I’m very 50/50 on how to feel.Lord forbid people wanna see Captain Marvel play a part instead of just sitting in the sidelines. If we were applying that line of thinking, why include Rocket or Ant-Man if it’s for the first era? They should at least do something instead of only popping in during the beginning and end. Steve doesn’t have to put on the gauntlet though?? What does that have to do with anything?? Yes, Tony has been foreshadowed to die before. But you know what else was foreshadowed? His marriage with Pepper and his role as a father figure to Peter. Some people wanted to see that side come full circle, and for it to just end the way it does is just dull.If this is how it’s all going down... it’s kind of disappointing. - Tony doesn’t get to live with the family he’s been building towards - Cap goes back in time instead of being at peace with the modern time - Captain Marvel barely does anything - Pepper is basically left widowed - Agent Carter is retconned in some sort of way - Cap just kind of... breaks the soul stone, but then it makes you wonder why he just didn’t do it in IW by the end. This just feels like such an unsatisfying close to the first era. I’m not planning to leave behind the MCU in any way, but this feels... kind of disappointing. I’m really *really* hoping this a fake leak. After all, this person showed up out of the blue right as this leak got popular.There was once this dude in high school who told me and my best buddy to shut up. Class was already over, so... he was just being a prick at that point. I responded with the age old fierce response of “You shut up.” The man immediately stormed over, and got up in my face, eye to eye, like he’s threatening me. “Say that again”, he says. I responded with “Dude... I don’t want to kiss you.” He never bothered me again. Remember kids, insinuating a macho assertion man’s sexuality isn’t straight is the best way to get them away.I don’t think Galactus is coming up immediately next. That’s someone you set up for the next few phases and entries. That I can understand Tony getting involved, but if it’s the new Avengers taking on a threat that’s still on earth? I dunno. By that point, we had other earth based threats that Tony didn’t get involved in (Winter Soldier, Dark World, Ant Man/and the Wasp, Doctor Strange, etc.) that would it be too out of place if he sits it out? I feel that what you’re saying though is exactly why this is gonna be the point where he retires. He’s backed out of it twice, because of that looming fear of Thanos. He’s been worried about him coming for so long. It would be way more satisfying if he finally got that finality. Thanos was slain, while sacrifices had to be made (Probably Cap or Rhodey) his biggest fear is finally gone. He can properly retire now. You make good points, but I feel Endgame is already a tragedy as is, with everything happening at once. Tony has had this arc where he and Pepper grow closer as he leaves behind his weapons, his suits, until he eventually has to return to the suit and fight again. A much more conclusive arc to this character we’ve been following for so long would be if he could finally say, with full confidence and no turning back, “I can retire.” The kid was brought up in Infinity War, yes, but the kid isn’t the central point. It’s about Tony finally being at peace and able to live a life with Pepper. tbh One way or another, I’m not gonna be surprised if he does die, since Far From Home seems... pretty absent from his influence. (Happy saying “You’re all alone” ESPECIALLY feels foreboding. Unless he’s just telling Peter that “Tony can’t keep coming to your aid with every struggle.”) But I’m cautiously optimistic, you know? Hopefully they can end his arc peacefully. But if not, welp. That’s gonna be a tearjerker for sure.That doesnt really resolve what I said though. You have all this build up for Tony’s completion and his happy ending, has a family, and can relax... then the story continues and he dies, getting that ending robbed away from him. I’m sure there are ways to explain Tony not being in future Avengers movies. Maybe he gets badly crippled in Endgame, or he finally puts his trust in the new leaders of the Avengers (like Captain Marvel for instance) and decides to retire. Plus, him coming back for cameos/maybe a final Avengers movie wouldn’t be too out of place. But he still sits out when it’s something the new crew can handleI mean, it makes sense, but... man, that’s just an unsatisfying end to the character. After everything set up with his wedding, to his child, it feels like to just rob him away from his happy ending would feel... kinda rough. You can easily say Tony retired from being Iron Man for good and still have the same results. You don’t have to apply Tony in further events and now everyone knows he’s probably out there with a family or something. You can still prove the MCU can be successful without killing off a character people love. Then again, I’m not the Russo bros, or Kevin Feige, or... anyone for that matter. So maybe they go through with it anyways, maybe they don’t... this Endgame wait is gonna be the end of me either way. XDI’d just add onto the current universe. No big changes other than placement. Phase 1 stays the same. Phase 2 has Spider-Man: Homecoming earlier, maybe a Wolverine Vs. Hulk movie as a semi-sequel to Incredible Hulk that sets up Mutants for Age of Ultron. Spidey and Wolverine also have roles in Ultron to really draw in the hype. Phase 3 introduces the Fantastic 4, since there’s more of a cosmic focus for this phase, and a proper X-Men movie takes place. Spidey’s role in Civil War is expanded and a tad more in line with the comics. Infinity War remains the same but now has the new additions helping out. (Maybe The Fantastic 4 help out the team on Titan whereas the X-Men help the Wakanda group.)But I feel we already had an idea that it was gonna take place in Europe, and that Mysterio would be the villain. We already had set leaks, so it wouldn’t be too shocking if someone just kind of worked with what they had and added plot around it. I dunno, maybe I’m wrong. The Stark Death is what I’m hoping doesn’t happen, and the trailer is just hiding things, but hey. They mentioned Jessica Drew, so if she gets any mention/appearance in the movie, then we’re bound to know. But until then, it’s still up in the air for me.My old Beardie was always hard to read. Reptiles tend to be more to themselves. I always took him out every morning so he could get some sunlight and walking time. One day, when I was about to put him back in his tank, he clung onto my shirt. At first, I was a bit confused, but I decided to sit back to play with him for a bit. He didn't play. He just laid there on my stomach. Maybe it was body warmth? I don't know. But he was staying there as if he wanted a small hug session, which I happily accepted as I put my hands over him softly. He was a sweetheart. He passed away two months ago and I still cry a bit over it. Love you Rex. Miss ya every day, you little pizzahead. ❤️I'll answer with a story from my girlfriend. She had a crush on this guy in middle school (great start) for a couple of reasons. One of the main points were that he was into Nintendo games like she was and was one of the only people that really talked to her at times. They both even hyped about Smash Bros stuff. Brawl in particular, since that was the fresh release at the time. One day in school, she was doodling Ice Climbers stuff. Those were (and still are) her go-to characters. She always presented them as a couple in her art, showing them hugging or kissing, you name it. So her crush sees and says \"Ew, aren't they brother and sister?\" In that heartbeat, her romantic feelings were flung out the window. Apparently the guy wasn't the best either way when she looked back before all that, but the Ice Climbers debate is what killed the love.Ooohhh my god this hit me to the core. I don't have a dog, admittedly. But I did have a Beardie. He was a lazy boy, but a sweetheart whenever you held him. His name, ironically, was Rex too. He passed away two months ago after living a good seven years. I still miss him every day, but I know he's happy now, not feeling anymore pain. Who knows? Maybe when my life reaches its end decades later, I'll see my little pizza head (my nickname for him ❤️) again. I owe him way too many hugs to count at this point.A funny thing I noticed is that with each new Smash game, a form of leaking gets way less credible. Melee and Brawl had the backyard \"I heard character A was in the game if you do this\". No one believed that for Smash 4. Smash 4 had roster leaks. The only one that was believed and true was the ESRB leak. But every minute there was a shaky cam roster pic. No one believed that by Ultimate. Now with Ultimate, people are now against insider leaks, and while some are kind of credible? Most people don't believe those anymore without concrete proof.I'd love to see a crossover like this! The only issue is that Capcom might have to walk around the whole \"killing Toho's main mascot\" deal. I'm imagining three ultimatums here. 1. Siege fight. Godzilla isn't killed, just merely driven away after dealing enough damage. 2. Subspecies. If Toho gives the go, make a similar looking species that fits the world of Monster Hunter. Make it small enough to go toe to toe, hint at a larger species that's even scarier to reference Godzilla, and you're good. 3. Just leave it be. Kind of feels weird if in the movies, Godzilla is this borderline invincible monster that requires other monsters or super weapons to defeat, and yet here all it takes is four hunters with really sharp swords to cut him down. Kind of feels lame sauce.Spending time with my Sister. She was a half sister from my dad's side, but she was super sweet and friendly. Always upbeat and in a good mood. I never really had time to bond with her since I didn't really want to spend too long with my dad's side. They lived in NY, and we were just kind of distant as a whole. Still. That never stopped my big sis. She was always chipper no matter what. My mom, grandma, and... well, myself, moved to Kissimmee for better opportunity and so my grandma won't take things so roughly from arthritis. Dad stayed behind since he had work. On the week before we left, he brought my sister so she could say goodbye, and things went well. Roughly a year later, my mom called me in tears. My sister died from a seizure that very morning. Dad was horribly distraught, having a full on breakdown. His friend had to contact us. I wish I could have said a more genuine goodbye. I wish I could have spend more time with her. I wish I could have shown her the same love and joy she showed me. That was the first funeral I've been to and I've never felt so sad until that very moment I saw her in a casket. I feel like such a lousy little brother. Yet I know she wouldn't want me to think that way. It's been a year since we've lost her. It still feels like just yesterday we got that awful news. All I can hope at this point is that she's bringing joy to all the angels up above. I love you, Paloma. If I could just spend one more day with you, I'd take it in a heartbeat.Ok. I love the Grumps, honestly look forward to watching their series each day... But man. This is painful. Arin pretty obviously doesn't want to play this. I can tell from the tone he just isn't motivated or enthusiastic about it. I was really hoping they could talk about some comics history or Dan reminiscing over New York, or... something. I'll admit that Spider-Kiss got me giggling, but at the same time it feels... half hearted? Is that the right word? Idk. I kind of wish they were playing a game they genuinely enjoyed like Mario Odyssey, or playing a game that honestly deserves the grumpiness like Sonic and the Secret Rings. Spider-Man is a great game, and I feel they aren't really giving it the time and day.Remember that one Drake and Josh episode where Josh was genuinely done with Drake's shit and basically cut him out his life? It wasn't even comedic or like \"haha, look at his angry annoyed reaction\". It was a full on \"I'm done with you.\" No exaggeration in the voice, no comedic spin, just that. Like the actors were getting out of character or something. Hell, Josh's life was even better when he cut out Drake. That shit fucking impacted me that two best friends falling out that hard can happen. Especially at the age of 7 or 8 when I saw it. I don't know if dark is the right word, but for a show that had Josh accidentally run over Oprah be treated like a gag, this episode got super real.When we first moved to Florida, we had no idea what we're doing. Things were rough and we eventually moved in with My Uncle for six months. First three months were fine and happy. Family bonded great, everything was swell. But this guy just really wanted to make life tough for us when we just wanted to get our house. He wouldn't sign one of the papers because his wife thought we'd take his house too since we helped buy it in our name (We were going to change this no matter what. Plus, we're family??? Why would we do that to you??), He would keep spoiling his grandkids and if we ever had a grievance, it was our problem. He would judge even the littlest things about me. Like why wasn't I in college? Why can't I drive? Why haven't I gotten a job yet? Shit that I already know is an issue. What broke the camel's back is when he started shit over my Bearded Dragon. He said I'm condoning animal abuse by keeping him in a tank (even though there's a fucking dog in the house who could hurt him, if not stress him out), that what I'm doing is no better than prison, etc. I fucking blew up on this guy. He has no right to even say this because he doesn't even treat his dog that well either. He doesn't know how to raise a Bearded Dragon so he has no right to say any of that shit. After that, shit was super tense between us. I would avidly refuse any group activity with that man. It doesn't help that he treated my grandma poorly afterwards over some petty jealousy that she cared for my mom more than him. With a son like that, I can see why she'd feel better with my mom tbh. He told her how she abandoned him (she left so she could get them a home in the US, her husband wouldn't give them the passports though so she couldn't take them.) and how she did poorly as a mother. My grandma's getting older and this shit for brains has the audacity to knock her down when the only reason we came to Florida in the first place was because she wanted to bring the family together. It's been a year since then. My mom and grandma have been on good terms again with him. I'm able to be in the same room and make small talk. Will I forgive him for what he said to us? Hell no. I won't start shit with him, but I'm not going out of my way to spend any time with him in some family meeting stuff. The man acts like a noble religious man when he was just as willing to knock us down at our weakest. TL;DR - Uncle started judging us and treating us badly in his house, said owning a pet lizard was animal cruelty and told my grandma (his mother) that she a bad mother to himI wouldn't say incel since this is when I was like, 13? 14? But whatever. I remember agreeing with the (at the time) meme mentality of \"Ugghhh the friend zone hahaaa\". I mean, if you've proven yourself and she only sees you as a friend, it's her fault, right? Welp. I saw another meme that showed the opposite reaction. Where it's just a girl who enjoys their friendship with the other person, they just don't see anything romantic. And then the guy gets mad and cuts her out of his life and etc. Seeing that made me realize \"Wait. Not everyone has to act all lovey dovey with the opposite sex. Maybe they just want to be buds regardless of emotions.\" So, yeah. I dropped off the incel mentality pretty quickly.It's... hard to explain. There are points where I feel like if I call it depression, it's just me being inconsiderate because some people have it worse... but... I'm not exactly happy. Some nights I just want to escape my house and find a peaceful bliss, sometimes I wish I could hitch a ride back to my hometown and never look back. I have to put up with so many people either looking over my shoulder or pestering me over little things. I feel like I'm useless here. Like I don't belong. Even in my friend circles I feel like everyone is just putting up with me out of pity. I don't know. It's just that feeling of the entire world collapsing onto you and there's nothing you can do to make it move. You just have to lay there and accept \"You'll never live up to the dreams you set out to do\" I... really need some therapy.Game Grumps - I can't even count how many times I've laughed. Dan and Arin are a delight and you ain't changing my mind on that. JaidenAnimations - It's just super chill and relatable stuff. Perfect background audio. Plus it's nice seeing Jaiden open up more lately. (Tbh this applies to other animated vloggers like TheOdd1sout and LetMeExplainStudios. This is just where I started lol) TierZoo - Only the most premiere strats for the hottest game on the block. What more can I say? RelaxAlax - I came for Know Your Moves. I stayed for the Game Design editorials. Also his voice is... oddly satisfying.There was once a girl I knew around middle/high school. Very pretty, had a cute smile, I thought \"Wow, she's one of the only people who can tolerate me! I feel weird fuzzy thoughts now!\" Unfortunately Middle School me is an idiot and said this to casual friends who weren't exactly quiet or subtle. She didn't tell me in person, but she pretty clearly didn't feel the same way. It stung at the time, but eh. I knew when to grow out of it. Though once that mess cleared up, I was super shy with people in general afterwards. It gave me small term social anxiety just to open up. Oh yeah and around that time I eventually had a small crush on another girl. But over time as we talked I felt she was better as a friend rather than anything too serious. Which played out nicely, all things considered!Christian Weston Chandler is pretty notorious on the internet. He (She since he came out as trans?) suffers from pretty severe autism and was (still is I believe) avid on the internet, posting webcomics of his OC, Sonichu. Eventually people discovered him and just went ham on the poor guy. Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan especially. But the funny thing is, Chris ended up making things rough for himself too as he just kept showing his colors through each angry YouTube vid. To put it bluntly, there really is no good/bad person in this situation. I can't explain it remotely as well as the documentary. It's so strange, yet weirdly fascinating.You gotta love the nihilistic person who's smarter and better than you in every way. They can get rid of their problems with a thought. They can take down entire armies by just being an asshole. Who's literally the best person ever also. Whenever they get development that they might not be a total ass, it has to be undone because they work in mysterious ways and only open up when it's convenient. Following off of this, there's the idiot character who's an absolute dick to everyone but they just kind of deal with it because \"They're the funny comic relief! It's ok!\" Don't forget the forced romance subplot that popped in out of the blue when the characters in question never showed any chemistry. The kid character who's entire personality is \"the kid.\" They're just loud and annoying and overreact to everything. I get that some kids are like this, but not everyone acts the exact same way.To be honest, I would have loved a scene where Thanos has Tony on the ropes, knocking on death's door, with Peter in desperation not wanting to lose another father figure. \"KAREN, ACTIVATE INSTA-KILL!\" \"I don't think that will-\" \"DO IT!!!\" It's activated. He lands a solid strike on Thanos. The Mad Titan reels back before feeling a small cut. This insect actually made him bleed a bit... What promptly follows is Spidey taking a walloping, but still doing his best to make sure his attention is off the other heroes so they can keep kicking.Easy. Three options. Three moral choices. Good - I wish that everyone will be able to live a happy life after I'm gone and that they won't suffer too much from whatever sadness I'll bring on my death. Neutral - I wish that my death will only happen decades from now. No rules, right? Evil - Just give me full godlike powers. Whatever I say, I get it. If I think it, I can create it with the snap of a finger. Honestly this is more chaotic neutral than evil since I won't be harming anyone intentionally, but it is the selfish as shit option. So hey.My friend at the time and I at 7th grade were kind of the laughing stock of the school. We didn't mind, but it wasn't subtle to anyone. I had this one crush on a girl, and she seemed fun. She had a pretty face, a tomboyish attitude, shit, I was into her. They paired her up with me and my friend in a project. Holy shit, she acted like we were riddled with AIDS or something. The second she had a chance to switch groups, she bolted to her other friends. Yeah, my crush on her shattered to dust at that point.To be honest, I feel this season is the best the show's been in for a while. I felt Season 3/4 were really lackluster. Season 3 had shit results have the time (they did Bowser dirty, man.) and Season 4 had zero fights to get hyped over. Just, overwhelming amounts of \"meh\" matchups with the exception of Megazord Vs. Voltron for me. Season 5 feels like it's a solid improvement for me, at least. The music could be improved? I mean I at least want to hear the character themes in the analysis. Writing feels the same to me as the previous seasons. And man, with the exception of Raven Vs. Twilight Sparkle, these matches have been quality after quality. I don't have many complaints so far. But, hey. Who knows what can happen until then?I don't know if this counts but I gotta tell this storyyy So I was once friends with a \"nice guy\". He wasn't that bad, at first. But whenever he wanted a relationship, he would almost always end up cheating on the girl. Because apparently if he wants puss, he gets puss... as much as a long distance bang he could get, at least. So we both had our eyes on the same girl eventually. He was DETERMINED to get her... through Roleplay. I don't mind RPs, but oof, this guy could fit comfortably at r/creepyasterisks. So, he would constantly try to woo her or flirt with her. He wanted me to be the wing man (Honestly, I don't want to watch my crush be wooed and have to give advice or whatever. If this were a genuine friend, I'd absolutely help. But this guy clearly doesn't have good intent. But, whatever.) He kept this up and kept adding more pressure all uncomfortably until he forced her to ask between him and me, who she'd choose. Spoiler alert: She and I have been very close friends beforehand and this guy just wants her for her body (even though he never met her in person??). So she confessed to me down the line, essentially. Holy fuck, this guy was upset. I wish I could post every message he made, but they're all buried in my private messages. But, wow. This guy. Oof. He made this huge angry tirade saying he'll delete his account if this girl doesn't hook up with him. She didn't. He deleted his account... until a day or two later where he decided to make a new account. He kept begging her to think things over, that she's the only one he wants. She chose not to feed into him, and he got upset and left to his own devices. He would attack me eventually, saying stuff like \"Oh, I take it you're still with [name]. Hmph. Dumb girl. I don't know what she sees in you.\" I proceeded to tear into him, telling him how he was a shitty person and was gonna block him. Not ten minutes later did I get a message from a friend telling me \"Dude, he's telling you to unblock him because he's real sorry or something.\" I'd unblock, and then M O R E A S T E R I S K S O H B O Y. It's hard to take someone seriously when they post \"*cries* I'm so sorry. I can't accept this. *runs away*\" Man, don't give me that asterisk shit. That's just crocodile tears to me. Plus, for \"running away\" he still ended up responding to me after. So... yeah. I cut him out of my life eventually. Me and the girl in this story have been together since. I don't know what this guy is doing, but from what I saw a year later, he did the exact same shit with another girl. And got himself in trouble. Again. So he probably won't ever learn.Oh boy, where do I begin? - The shy guy who just so happens to be able to get 50 girls, is the chosen one, and doesn't grow at all as a character other than \"O-Oh, geez, I don't know if I can do it guys\" - The girl who's just there to be the love interest. Like, zero personality. Except she has to bang the dude at the end. This also applies to the \"Token Babe.\" AKA The character who's there for fanservice and not much else. - Villains who do things just because. I love villains who pose not just a threat physically, but they challenge the hero's ideal. You can beat them physically, sure. But you very well could prove their point in doing so. Mustache twirling villains are just there to be the hurdle. That's it. - Forced Pairs. You can have a character who's perfectly fine as someone single, or not into romance. When suddenly, they're thrusted into a relationship and 99% of the story from then on is the character panicking about his/her love interest. - The Child of the Main Character who's literally just the main character but younger.Oooo I can tell HUNDREDS of stories of my little cousin here. The kid just hollers and screams for no discernible reason other than \"he likes the sound of his own voice.\" He calls me and my mom names, but never gets in trouble because \"haha he's just a funny kid.\" He kisses up to my Grandma if he knows he's not gonna get his way with me. The worst part is she falls for it. Every. Single. Time. That kid is just a toxic part of my life making me debate on just living in a dorm for college. Luckily, while he's spoiled with his mom, his dad won't let him get away with any of that. So on those group getaways where he's with his dad, things get satisfying if he's being a little asshat.It's less the reason why she had the tantrum... and more how she released said tantrum. I was letting her play on the DSi I had back then. Important note, don't let kids play with your DS, unless you want to have to pry it out from their tiny and wrathful grasp. I told my aunt because I had nothing to do, and the tiny tot wasn't listening to me when I tried to ask for it back. I'd be willing to give it back later if she needed it. So my aunt decided to ask for it back. She was starting that tantrum up again, and auntie wasn't having it. She took back the game, and this girl was FREAKING OUT. Like, not only did she cry, but she proceeded to slam her head on the floor. That was just embedded in my memory. I have another little cousin who's the Bane of my existence and has the most annoying tantrums. Then again, I could fill a page with what weird shit he's done.First of all? Hook up with some random girl in an online game at the age of 11 or 12. Second? Take it that seriously. Man, I was acting like \"yes me and this girl are so happy together I'm gonna meet her I'm gonna cuddle her life will be great\". Oof, that was a wild time. We both did embarrassing crap. We'd make not subtle posts venting over each other in other websites, we never made the effort to fix an argument and just argued a lot. It was messy. But hey! Now I have my current relationship... also... made... long distance... Hey, I've actually met up with this girl this time. I've learned from my mistakes.One time in Middle School, April first, I was around 10? Or 11? I don't recall. We were at history class, and our teacher (a chill dude) made little doodles. He said \"they probably look bad, but hey.\" I wanted to joke around and say \"That's the worst art I've ever seen!\" And follow it up with a light hearted \"April Fools! It's good art!\" I said the first part. And then every student hollered and screeched like I just insulted the man's mother. Never got to say the joke part. The Teacher was never really upset at me but all the students thought I was Hitler. To be honest, most of those students were the douchy popular ones, but still.I wouldn't say \"Dream\", but I was planning for my gf's visit to Florida a ton. She was gonna bunk in at our home and we'd head to Disney World. Specifically, Animal Kingdom. She hasn't been there, and I friggin loved the park, so I was happy to show her. Then, it rained. We wanted to go a day after, but after the rain, Animal Kingdom tends to be not that great. Tons of animals are indoors, rides are closed. It blows. So, we decided, \"hey, Magic Kingdom is bound to be open! Let's try that!\" God it was even worse If I can describe Magic Kingdom, it's \"When do we get to the ride?\" \"This IS the ride!\" god those lines It's the beginning of summer. Everyone is out of school. We waited in the Pirates of the Caribbean line for 2 FUCKING HOURS. And every other ride had a solid hour long wait. Rain popped in randomly, making it humid as hell. The crowds were so hard to navigate. The food tasted like crap. It was an awful experience, which was a shame since I really wanted my girlfriend to have a great time. Luckily. She isn't the type to get mad, and was chill over it. We just decided to go home, eat some pizza, and then watch Incredibles 2 later. Good meet up, all things considered. Though I'm not touching Magic Kingdom with a 10 foot pole until the crowds die down. Animal Kingdom for life babyyyWe were in a school project together. Our group was doing... something science related. This was all the way back in 7th Grade. Me and this other guy weren't making too much convo, but we were making dumb jokes here and there. We were still doing the work, mind you. Just goofing around also. During said goof, someone said \"stop\", and we simultaneously thought to freeze in place in the very stance we had. That guy is one of my best friends now. Funny enough, Same thing happened with another dude. I was drawing. He sat by. One thing lead to another and he made a joke about a banana in Mortal Kombat being the best character. Also my best friend.The house I live in is driving me nuts. Yes, I love my family still, but I don't know if I can take it. My little cousin is still a spoiled brat, screaming for no reason other than because yes. My grandma is still enabling him to do so and spoiling him. The only normal person I can talk to is my mom, nowadays. I need a job. I need a car. I have so much I need to do before eventually moving out. I just need an escape. Whether it's a vacation or not, I don't know. The sad part is, I used to love kids. If you needed a babysitter, I'll gladly handle things. But after dealing with my little cousin for so long, I don't even know if I want kids of my own anymore.Thanks. Looks like so far a thumbs down on the Ardents. I had them on a single speed rig years ago when 2.0 was consider fat and thought they where pretty good but that’s totally different rig and size so I have no idea how much they’ve changed or how they feel at 2.4. Overall how does the aggressor feel back there? I’m lucky enough to live by the rock mtns and my local trails are good mix of rooty, rocky, flowy, loose over hard, and kitty litter over hard during the summer and fall. Spring and the cool months is different beast all together. I throw my fronts to the rears and throw on an Assegai on the front of my rigs to deal with wet.Dear Ukrainians! I heard on social media that there is fake news being spread (most likely by Russia backed trolls) that polish border is closed. It's a lie. If you seek asylum - go towards polish border. We are ready for your arrival. We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid. Polish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl Please share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now. YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!! proof that you no longer need visa: • ⁠in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua • ⁠in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en copied from u/everysir to spread awareness! please spread on relevant threads to get the word out!!!I know that this is pathetic.. co workers (not the boss, the boss was out that day) threw a small “party” in the break room. He freaked out and got extremely angry. Co workers were upset and told boss. Boss asked co worker why he got unreasonably angry, and the dude was clenching his fists furious during this conversation. This “victim” is pathetic. He could’ve just left the room, not caused all this for himself and the company as well as his co workers. He’s probably making out with around 100k, and now this is on his record and he has to find a job with his “anxiety disorder”. Pathetic society we live inThe average person does not have medical debt. A million dollars is not an incredible amount that is unattainable, and the fact you think that is just sad. You are keeping yourself down. We live in a capitalist society, so you think you will become a millionaire from a lower than normal job, with no investing? I don’t give a shit what your idea is about me, that doesn’t matter. You think I’m “privileged” because I have an ounce of intelligence and a larger grasp of making money than i can sadly say you do. I have seen it first hand the road from poverty to middle class and now a paved path to being wealthier. Not everyone is incapable. The fact you genuinely believe a million dollars is impossible to achieve, and ridiculous to say that it is achievable by everyone is just sad how low your goals are for yourself. If there is a race with no time limit, even if you start earlier you will eventually get to the “finish line” even if they have sticks in the path. Some won’t, but some will. But, of course people who sit on Reddit all day think that being wealthy in impossible.Making minimum wage is a stupid CHOICE. Everywhere is hiring for more than minimum wage, even in Louisiana. Easily make 12$+ with no experience, and a kid I know is making 30-50$ an hour consistent just from working as a host in a restaurant with no experience. Your not a victim, not everyone is a victim from their own choices. The United States is the easiest place to become wealthy, and is the easiest place to have a normal middle class life, at least. People are just pathetic and are creating issues because they’re are noneI wouldn’t trust anything from this vaccine. Not even our healthcare employees trust it. I was speaking to a family member who is a nurse and she said more than half of her co workers aren’t vaccinated and they are highly against it. She also spoke about how they don’t even give people who are vaccinated COVID tests (so anytime they said people with vaccine don’t get COVID, it’s because they aren’t testing them). This whole situation is stupid. Why is it unvaxdd people’s fault? The scientists knew that a VIRUS would mutate, and that unless EVERYONE was vaccinated, which they knew wouldn’t happen, then it wouldn’t mutate.Locally: no mandate for masks, State: Revive our port, tax reductions, a set state minimum wage that’s thought through for cost of living, invest more in public infrastructure, legalise marijuana (and set high taxes on it) Federally: we’d have a gold standard, less taxes, invest more in infrastructure (even if that’s cutting ~10% of our military budget), finish building the wall, send less aid but maintain global dominance (that sounds so fucked up but IMO it’s either us, Russia, or China having that place), create WAY more power plants and possibly provide funding for them, work towards true free healthcare markets, and STOP GIVING SO MANY COLLEGE LOANS, which should happen after the gold standard is enacted. I feel like all of this is for the better of everyone and would actually provide a better live. I don’t like that dems like to look at themselves like they want to help everyone, but only give unreasonable solutions, or solutions that are so extreme to a simple problem. Ex: why make college free, instead of making it affordable? Same with healthcare. College keeps the value, and healthcare keeps the qualityLiberals organised a 7month long riot causing 23 dead, 700 officers to be injured, 50+ federal businesses to be damaged, and hundreds of small businesses to be destroyed. With no repercussions. A few conservatives spent a day at the capital, only 1 person was shot, 14 officers were injured, and BOTH sides condemned this. Please never say shit about conservatives “rioting” to “overturn the votes”. Many conservatives believed there was fraud for a 100% valid reason.. if you actually believe 80 Million people support Joe Biden, (which who knows, liberals wanted anyone but trump) a child sniffing man who hasn’t done shit in his 50 years, a man who’s made racist and homophobic statements, yet wants to fix racism and homophobia, a man who ran with KAMALA HARRIS, you have an issue. But hey, maybe liberals are that stupid to vote him in. Dominican is mainly used in places that they suppress votes so why the fuck wouldn’t we check it?Joe Biden has said he wants to raise the minimum wage to 15$ an hour, which would have heavy consequences. In most areas, especially the south, you DON’T need 15$ an hour to live. It would force almost all of the businesses that are already struggling out of business, and it would strengthen the monopolies. When joe Biden said he wants to raise the minimum wage, it doesn’t take a genius to analyze the ramifications of that. You can look at his policies that he supports and see the consequences. I’m glad you put all your trust into a man because his policies have to be better than trumps. And I’m so glad you ignore the consequences of his policiesI don’t. I get my news from r/politics so I can see both sides of the argument. There’s no point in arguing on fucking reddit. All media is gonna be biased to some degree and it’s very apparent reddit is leaning to the left. Stop acting like the donald did something wrong other than not being left. You didn’t provide any facts, just theories. It very well could be that they moderated it very well but reddit didn’t agree with their political stance, and it could be the other way. I would never dream of trump killing social media and that’s nowhere near what he’s doing. You can read about what the new order imposes. Remember liberals are not the majoritythat’s fucked up. like genuinely, i can’t tell if reddit says that shit with humor or not. Joe Biden is a pedophile. You can ignorantly argue and call Trump one too, but there’s videos of Biden sniffing little girls and inappropriately violating them. Biden obviously has a mental issue. You can falsely argue “oh trump acts so stupid he must have one too”, yet biden literally has fucking dementia. He stumbles on his words so much it takes up half the fucking sentence, and he can’t even form a coherent statement. Trumps done more good in 4 years than biden has in his 40. It’s funny how reddit really believes dems will win in this election. It’s such an anti-american pro china circle jerk that they really think their beliefs are the majority. Hilarious. I’m sorry, but the democrats yet again fucked themselves this election. You can waste your vote on Biden but why say stupid shit like that? first award thanks so much for having sense!No. Those at high risk should self isolate whilst the economy opens up and those who are healthier go back to work. My mother has lung cancer and is at risk. Guess what she does? She stays at home and she isolates because she is afraid of the virus. She doesn’t go to the store, she instead does curbside pickup to reduce interaction. I’m glad to be in louisiana where non-essential businesses have finally opened up and life is starting back up. Reddit is just a gigantic circle jerk of ignorant liberals who pretend to care for everyone and act like an amazing person. In reality, everyone would choose their own family over a random persons life. Quit acting like you would rather not have a job and struggle to feed your family because you don’t wanna put the few people that are susceptible to the corona virus at risk— they should not be out and about if they know they are at risk!he never specifically stated any type of disinfectant. You just stretched the truth. he said it would be interesting to see if there’s a way to inject a disinfectant (obviously a safe one) into a body to kill the virus. if that was possible it would obviously be effective. he also said it was be interesting to see if there’s a way to use uv lights to kill the bacteria, which is already a thing and has been proven to work and used in the past. he never recommended this, he was speaking to a doctor about finding out the legitimacy of those ideas. and in all honesty, i agree with him publicly asking these questions. especially as they aren’t ridiculous ideas at all. both are very realistic.You can’t compare a tv remote, a microwave, and a star millions of miles away to towers that are miles away, (if your lucky), that are powering hundreds of thousands of devices. There’s a difference between a little amount and a LOT. You can take a little amount of heroin but if you take a lot you will overdose. I can’t stand reddit’s ignorance. You never gave me a source. source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1438463917308143?via=ihub and a more controversial source (only controversial on reddit of course) https://www.wootva.com/2019/12/25/5g-and-q-whats-potus-have-to-say-about-this-taking-to-the-8kun-board/ u/tomjonesdronesYour response literally makes no sense. Radiation is always in contact with us, yes. MMW may have existed in minuscule levels, but they have never been placed within miles of our homes. Their is literal evidence of illness being caused by this. Radiation has always been here, but in high levels it is TERRIBLE for your health. Ever remember going to the doctor for a xray and the doctor hides behind a screen to prevent the radiation? Ever seen that astronauts have higher cancer rates due to the radiation in outer space? So why are you people so okay with radiation on this level for higher internet speeds?! And this is a response. Like i said OP asked why people are against 5g. Me being a person against it, I explained my reasoning. Therefore, my response is a valid answer.Answer: 5g is terrible for your health. The frequency of it is known to cause severe illness and having 5g is not really that necessary anyway. To add to the stigma, a 5g chinese company called “Huawei” has been known to spy on the population. The 5g utilizes MMW’s or Millimeter Waves which are absorbed into the human skin. When/if 5g is deployed, much of the nation would be exposed to MMW’s for the first time on a continuous basis. Prior to 5g being rolled out, many scientist disapproved and warned against the use due to the many health dangers. In addition, MMW radiation targets and effects water, cell plasma membrane, and genomes. I am also against 5g, so this is a legitimate answer.2014 2 of my good friends 2015 my aunt 2016 my dog 2017 my grandmother 2018 other dog Last week my grandfather I know exactly how you feel its rough but you cant live in constant fear of losing people or pets itll drive you nuts and youll just shut down i almost lost my job because i just spaced out and couldnt do anything or just didnt want to but you gotta keep pluggin away dont give up , life is a game everyone looses eventually but you gotta have fun while you play, nobody likes a sore loserFired right up but the brakes were locked up so i had a buddy flat bed it home. I need to re do some crusty wiring and the gas tank,the carb could use a once over and the interior is complete garbage. I replaced the brakes i put power brakes on , disc on the front and kept the drum in the back i put new shocks and springs in the rear and was driving around with it till i noticed the gas tank leaking out of a small hole on top of the tank. Edit: also the rims he had on it were garbage random rims so my grandfather gave me his rims off his 89 s10 to throw on for now Edit2: i forgot i also put brand new copper brake lines on and power brakes and new master cylinder.Parrotlets are biters for sure haha. I have a parrotlet and 2 budgies, I never let them all out of the cage at once, my parrotlet is allowed to crawl on their cage but never inside (parrotlets love to bite feet, and can get aggressive very quickly). They prefer flight cages over height, and need toys to attack/chew. This baby looks so small! Anyway, if you do decide to keep him, parrotlets are incredibly smart and capable of giving so much love and showing great affection. Definitely my favourite bird, but again, don't trust them around other pets (MAYBE if there is no aggression towards your budgies, they could interact during playtime, but never let him near your cat as they have been known to attack larger pets and die or get injured as a result). Thank you rescuing this little baby. Oh, I havent looked at the photo much yet but you can visually determine sex, males have dark blue feathers under their wings and almost a light eyeliner wing? The eyeliner can be a bit less noticeable, but check the next time they stretch their wings.Eminem himself knows and admits that he wouldn't be the best selling rapper of all time if he wasnt white (and not because what being white made of him) because White Americans certainly do love supporting white people. That's the reason there are so many people that \"Dont listen to rap\" but love Eminem and other white rappers like NF. Ems advantage comes in making music that appeals to actual rap fans because its quality music, and still has pop appeal, and hes white, so the \"I dont listen to rap\" people dont judge his music as saying the n word a bunch of times and talking about guns and drugs, so they give it a listen. Em is certainly goated, and it's not the necessarily I think he absolutley doesn't DESERVE the number one spot, but he didnt get it only because he deserved it. America is rigged against African Americans and the rap game is no different.>glossy un-relatable music these days Jay dropped 4:44 the same year Em dropped Revival. Sit down, bro. \"Many of Kanye’s beats that made him the rap icon that he is, and he is known to sucker punch other rappers in the industry while Eminem elevates raps artists he likes and isn’t threatened by them.\" - Donda featured so many new artists that admire Ye, on the other hand, shady records fucks over their artists. \"Eminem isn’t my favorite rapper but lyrically he crushes Jay Z\" He is better at rhyming and rapping fast yes, but these days Em has nothing worth saying to say, while Jay does, And overall Jay is a better album maker. I prefer Marshall Mathers LP to any Jay album, but Jay has way more consistency than em, especially in recent years. But this is not about Jay VS Em, this is about the fact that somehow, Eminem is the best-selling rapper of all time by almost twice as much as any black artist IN A BLACK GENRE. It's not because he is really that much better than any black rapper, it's because he's white.Just say you know nothing about music and move on bro. Aint no such thing as \"Different Octaves\", obviously the instrumentals are going to be different, BPM can vary between songs and they will still be similar (Shocker) and I will give you the drum thing they are different. But he is very obviously talking about the melody, which is almost Identical. Tyler didn't sample / interpolate / steal anything because the melody Tyler used for \"I Thought You Wanted To Dance\" came from the sample for the instrumental, and the sample is way older than both songs. The chord progression in a few of the parts in solanges song is the same as the one from Tylers sample. They have a similar BPM, chord progression, and groove.Lemme ask you this tho, how many songs off CLB do you really think need analyzing and thinking about to understand? The album is packed with songs that pretty much don't have any depth to them. Even the songs I liked (For example Pipe Down) don't really have anything worth going back to if you don't like them. You can pretty much tell on the first listen whether you like them or not, what is the song about, there's not really anything in the production that jumped out for me after a couple of listens.Nonstop Gods Plan I'm Upset In My Feelings Mob Ties Can't Take A Joke Talk Up (+ Mediocre Jay feature) Is There More Peak (Terrible Mix, That synth is UNLISTENABLE) Summer Games Jaded Nice For What That's How You Feel Blue Tint This is a list of songs that I think are mediocre or straight-up bad from the album &#x200B; Now here is the list of songs that I think are interesting / good / great 8 Out Of 10 Survival Ratchet Happy Birthday Don't Matter To Me (Even if Michaels vocal isolation sucks) Final Fantasy This is NOT balanced \\+ Drakes bars on the album are so dry for the most part. If a song is saved it's probably because of the beat / sound. I don't get any sense of personalty on this album. At least in some of his albums, I feel what drake is trying to say.Ye was better but bodied is extreme. Call My Bluff beat was extremely weak and disappointing and the whole song could have been scrapped and I wouldn't give a shit. This is the only problem I had with Pharrell's side of the album. Also for some reason, the mixing on I Pray For You was kinda bad. The Rim Shot sounded low quality and was mixed really low... I honestly liked the drums Pharrell used in every song, so I don't really care if they're the same. I really like this side of Pharrell tho, chill drums and a very not chill, huge fucking 808 is kind of a vibe. Pharrell & Ye are my favorite artists (Also Tyler) So I'm glad we got both of them working on this album.I gotta be honest, a lot of these problems come from the fact that I'm on a MacBook and don't have a mouse, so if I make a mistake I gotta slowly navigate with a trackpad to fix it, and also the UI is kinda hard to press. I guess some of the UI elements really can be designed better but everything is FINE. Also, it beats a lot of other DAWs in a lot of critical features. (Best stock plugins and sounds, good audio recording, Workflow integration, most UI elements, Design, and it's really cheap for a DAW)Also, it's WAY too long and Drake obviously does not put the same effort as he puts in 8/10 as he does into God's Plan. A lot of this album sounds like it was made to guarantee there will be a hit somewhere in the tracklist. (God's plan delivered on that ig)n almost every way (even tho the hook is kinda catchy). Also, it's WAY too long and Drake obviously does not put the same effort as he puts in 8/10 as he does into God's Plan. A lot of this album sounds like it was made to guarantee there will be a hit somewhere in the tracklist. (Gods plan delivered on that ig) The album does not have a cohesive feel really, the highlights are all over the place, and the bad songs are just the same. Even in his worst Drake shows, he can put out good songs (8/10 for example) but he just does not care enough to make a whole album of quality stuff. I think if you were to take only a few good songs from More Life, Scorpion, and Certified Lover Boy you could actually make something worthwhile. Also - this is a very specific nitpick, but the song Don't matter to me is offensive to MJ's legacy, the vocal extraction sounds like trash and the song was made to attract more attention by including Michael.How can you be a fan of Eminem and be offended when you get called a dickrider? Also, I didn't call everyone who said MTBMB is good a dickrider, and it has nothing to do with not agreeing with my take. It's just a fact that most of Ems fanbase agree the album is not as good as SSLP, but some people will say it just to defend Em even if they don't think it's true. I'm a Kanye fan and I like Jesus Is King a lot. I still think most people who say it's not his worst album are kinda dickriders. Not specifically because I disagree, but because I know that's what a dickrider would say. Also, saying stuff that you're going to be called a dickrider for is not brave.I don't care what Anthony thinks about records. I watch his videos because I just think they're fun. He gave plenty of albums I love bad reviews and plenty of albums I don't like good reviews. I just think based on what I know about Anthony's taste and his reasoning as to why he didn't like the song, it just didn't click with him at the time, and he might like it better now. Also, he re-reviewed albums already and gave them a much higher score, and said that some songs he didn't like the first time around grew on him, so it's not such an absurd thing to say he might like the album more than he did then. \"The mental gymnastics you're performing to make his opinion líne up with yours in your own head is terrifying\" - I think Anthony's viewers will go out of their way to make it look like they're not following him blindly.>please please please please keep doing your thing, your going to be AWESOME!!!!! Thank you! it means a lot to hear that from a fellow musician. \"Ultralight Beam is just a organ and drum slowed down to the lowest BMP within his flow. Jake Cave, Common, Ben Harper, Tupac, and more have done it before.\" Let me describe to you how I see the track. First of all, it's not an organ, it's reversed Rhodes Piano. So the piano starts out quiet and as the bar is spoken more tension is added until the bar is finished and the tension is broken. The bassline is a pitched down vocal that amplifies the Rhodes. Instead of using a traditional bass (which I heard on cover versions of the instrumental and it sounds totally awkward), Kanye chose to use a human voice run through autotune to get the texture, and yet still introduce a futuristic, synthetic sound to an otherwise more natural, but plain sounding instrumental. The drums are these pitched down, cut off samples of actual drums. You can clearly hear the tone of actual kick drums and snares, yet the pattern and the way they are cut off and pitched down is introduced to go along with the bassline. A perfect mix of synthetic and natural. And my favourite part is the gorgeous choir arrangement that alternates between being up close and personal to distant and powerful. It's perfect in my opinion. The drums are these pitched down, cut off samples of actual drums. You can hear the tone of actual kick drums and snares, yet the pattern and the way they are cut off and pitched down is introduced to go along with the bassline. A perfect mix of synthetic and natural. This is what I hear when I listen to this track.I probably miss judged. If your production skills are on par with your guitar playing you can definitely produce. And producing 3 albums is hard no matter what. But it's insane to me that someone who has produced 3 full projects cannot see what it takes to create an album like Kanye's. \"I've heard songs like that before.\" Do you mind telling me which songs? About stuff that I've produced, I don't release anything but I'm constantly working on things ranging from Hip Hop to Soul to Funk. I don't release anything (I'm only 16) but if you truly care you can reach out and I'll send you some stuff. I also got this [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWDEcnbhCP4&t=4s) where I remake Tyler, The Creator songs from scratch.Notice that I didn't mention musical ability. I will say I should have been more specific when I said \"You just clearly do not know a lot about music and how it's made\" and probably should have worded it better I believe there are a lot of people who can play music that don't know anything about the landscape of music. You can be able to improvise for an hour and have no idea what makes a good album. There is a lot more to music than being able to play it. And that is how we get people like Ben Shapiro who is amazing at playing the violin but would tell you with a straight face that Rap isn't music. They can play the music but they don't know anything about music. You can play the guitar (and you're talented) but do you really think you could make an album by yourself? an album of the same quality as Kanye's albums? Also, do you think what you're playing in that video is as good as Ultralight Beam (the song I linked you to earlier) Genuine questions.I left one incredibly micromanaged position for another that was even worse. They literally had sticks with signs taped to the top at each cubicle. One side of the sign had a question mark for if you needed management assistance. The other side indicated you needed a bathroom break. About 150 employees all adults in one giant room and we'd have to wave a fucking sign to ask to go to the bathroom. I quit after six months. I also filed a complaint with the department of labor and industry..and I won. 😃I agree. I hate when I'm standing in line somewhere and a mom with a baby is obviously waiting for me to comment on how adorable their child is. Well, I'm not commenting. They aren't adorable. 😐 I also hate being made to feel like a monster for not liking kids. I find them to be loud, sticky, annoying little creatures. A child crying is like sticking razor blades in my ears. I avoid child/family friendly places. I've walked out of restaurants to avoid sitting near infants. 🙃 I'd never harm a child, I just don't want to be near one.Perhaps you should take a dose of your own medicine and not give out fallacy and misinformation as truth. Any substance you put in your body can and will have impact. Negative side effects of puberty blockers include changes in bone density (which can lead to osteoporosis) and fertility issues. Neither of these are minor inconveniences. They're long term and high impact consequences that can greatly alter a person's life. Additionally there may be other long term side effects the medical community is not yet aware of. This is why they are prescribed 'experimentally'.Maybe last minute change of heart? Riddled with guilt? Scared of the reality of being alone with this giant nazi monster and realizing she was in way over her head? She could of been flip flopping on going through with it or not. I actually considered she was uncertain when she scheduled an appointment for herself claiming she wasn't feeling well. Like if she got out there and couldn't following through she could arrive at the doctor's and said he kidnapped her or some shit without being charged for aiding a fugitive escape.I genuinely think she was lonely and believed - ignorantly - that he could fill that void From the little I read her coworkers didn't think much of her - one guy spoke to the media and commented on her appearance saying while she was 57 yo she appeared to be 75! She took care of her former drug addicted ex husband through his Parkinsons disease until he died and recently lived with her mother Then she has this man 20 yrs her junior showing an interest in her and BAM! She's gonna give him the world, to the best of her ability Of course within days she's in a position as a fugitive and probably coming to the realization that he doesn't give a damn about her 🙄 I read it as she felt this was a last attempt at love, career, pension, and reputation be damnedMy theory: he knew someone in Evansville - a plug 🔌 as they say - and he coerced her into staying there while he went on a meth binge ..maybe got her to try it too toxicology report should be interesting No doubt she regretted this decision quickly..she's all in love thinking they are gonna drive off into the sunset and live happily ever after and his dumb ass just wants to get high I'd imagine she realized fast they'd be caught soon they only made it 200 miles in what? 10 days? And with 90k cash! UnbelievableI don't even blame him!! that bitch wife of his has him so emasculated telling the world she fucks other dudes and shit No one would even remember this bitch of it wasn't for him keeping her funky ass in the spotlight I dont even believe she has alopecia how bout that alopecia doesn't cause baldness in that neat little cut she's sporting Google it She's a bitch period and I won't watch his stuff anymore either NOT because I don't support him but because I won't put a dime of my money into that whores pocket fuck that nasty hoShort Story time: 4 active duty young Marines, we are VERY poor had a night out partying with my bf, his buddy, and my female friend My boyfriends friend was Puerto Rican, spoke in broken English. He often has a hard time finding the right word in English, especially when he's stressed out. While frustrating for him, it could be hilarious to everyone else. So we drank entirely too much and decided to get a hotel room, but working from that active duty private pay minus our alcohol tab, we needed to pitch in on one room, 2 beds. Fast forward an hour or two in the room, my boyfriends buddy is getting hot n heavy with my friend in the bed next to us. Gross, I realize, but I digress... He takes her pants off and makes this weird choking gagging sound, and just SCREAMS out of nowhere CHEESE DOODLES!! She was called CHEESE DOODLES forevermore.. The end. Edited to say, I do feel sorry for her in hindsight. I'm sure being referred to that way must of made her feel bad about herself, even though she tried to laugh it off.You sound like a great dad. Trust your instincts. One piece of advice my mother gave me was sleep with dogs, get fleas. Be weary of the company your kids keep. Even from a young age avoid them being around kids who take risks, or (sadly to say) around kids whose parents are users. I'm a mom too, being a parent is constant worry. And it never gets easier. I'm not saying keep your kids locked down with no freedom. But monitor them closely. Who are they spending time with? Kids are innocent until someone shows them how to do something not so innocent. Monitor their social media. And have open conversations about drugs and alcohol and the dangers. You obviously care for your children very much. Stay close to them, let them know they can come to you about anything, and I'm sure you'll all do fine!Everyone let this girl down. Her mother allowing her to be exposed to drug abusers and not protecting her from her brother, her 'friends' who let her go outside alone intoxicated and not properly dressed for the weather, the lead detective on the case. The filmmaker seemed genuinely concerned for the welfare of Christina and her young daughter. She was pretty far reaching in her quest for police on camera interviews and 80-question letters. No police department is going to respond to those requests. My impression is that she has an underlying distrust of police. With the way the media force feeds the public anti-law enforcement rhetoric, I'm not surprised she leans that way. I've read credible reports Christina threatened self-harm the night she disappeared. Being so close to the Mississippi River, my theory is that she took her own life, or went near the river and had a fatal accident. Most of the theories posited on this show are too far-fetched for me to believe. The simplest answer is usually the correct one.Not sure I agree she's popping oxy's. She says she takes pain meds, but that means different things to different people. I'll say I took pain medication and be referring to ibuprofen. Also at her weight class and seeing how she already has respiratory illnesses I doubt any doctor worth a salt would prescribe a respiratory depressant like oxy. Additionally oxy and narcotics like it have reduced appetite as a side effect. Clearly this bitch has no problems with her appetite. Just a few reasons I feel it unlikely she's a pill head.Its as cold as a dead fish.. The news coverage is out of hand. There's NOTHING to report so they find the most insignificant, unrelated thing to make a click bait headline. And they're struggling with that lol. Today's top headlines include 'Florida Cowboy Says Brian Wouldn't Have Survived the Swamp'. And 'For the Dog The Bounty Hunter the Search is Personal'. Haha. Hahahaha! Florida cowboy knows all!! And Wtf does dog the bounty hunter have to do with anything?? I'm done. I'm sure I'll be notified via news when he'd found.I could write a book of these We had a 1980s K car (ugliest cheapest car ever) around 2005..the gas tank had rusted out at the top so you could only fill it to about a quarter tank or it'd leak I overfilled it one day before driving to a rite aid parking lot..came out of the store to the city fire department around the car cleaning up a gas spill...I was mortified Lived in a house that had previously caught on fire with my family as a teen...there was no real bathroom just a toilet and a hose coming out of the ceiling in the basement for a makeshift shower...the walls and ceiling in what should have been the dining room were peeled off from the fire..there were metal bars on the windows like a prison..my friends dad drove me home one day and I was so embarrassed of where I lived I had him drop me somewhere else and walked the rest of the way Food stamps - back in the 90s when they were still still the paper ones - I would rather starve then use them...I was about 90 lbs as a teenager because I refused to buy food like that I had to steal my school clothes because my mother couldn't afford them... Ran out of gas and had to get to work the next day..called a friend who had triple AAA so I could get a free gallon of gas..Sat in my car for 2 hours waiting for the tow truck The list goes on and onI've experienced the downward slope...I worked as a dispatcher at a 911 call center for 6 years...the micromanagement became so absurd I left, stupidly, for another call center in Healthcare What a f'ing mistake! My new job was worst than the last...even if we had a question or issue we couldn't stand up from our seats...we had to waive a question mark flag in the air GTFOH!! Fortunately I do have a BA and I'm a vet, so I was able to secure myself a federal job that doesn't envolve micromanagement or public interaction ..FINALLY I don't want to off myself every morning now onmy way to work as I actually enjoy my job Like others have said it can help gain skills and can be used as a jumping off point...but I'd highly recommend keeping it as a casual, leave qt any time type position 😉Just started season 2. All I have to say is I still can't stand Tammy! Any empathy I had for her has all but dissipated! I could care less if she fails completely. She's so entitled, obviously has had people (i.e. Amy) wiping her a** her whole life so now expects it. (Mean this figuratively, but wouldn't be surprised if it were literal). Amy says 'Tammy has taken a step back from her weight loss...' ya don't say! I think she looks heavier now than ever. Tammy's such a lazy bitch...doubt I'll finish anymore episodes its just more of the same. Everyone on eggshells around Tammy. I'd leave her to lay there. Glad they are bringing the brother in to help now. Amy probably needs the break.Spent a couple hours in a holding cell once ...I know it doesn't count for much and for that I am glad...but in those few hours I met some very diverse and interesting people..a heroin addict, a prostitute, a thief, and some bitch arrested for beating the shit out of her three kids who was crying inconsolably...I try my best to not do anything that would land me in a jail, or worse yet prison cell, having known a number of people who had to go down that road and how terrible their experiences are...and also how every.single.one.of.them came back fucked in the headwrong! I'm late to the post, but... not my proudest moments, but I dated a guy...total junkie asshat..he was stabbed over a drug debt and transported to ER...due to the violent nature of his injuries, PD responded and he came back with warrants...while laying in a hospital bed with stab wounds/cut marks all over waiting to be taken to jail after medically cleared, he asks me to go out to my vehicle (my vehicle! fucking dick) where he had hidden a literal half pound of drugs (subs/H/methadone type shit)...I bring them in like the dumb ass I was ...and right in front of me he inserted them up his assI 100% agree. There's been a phone ban at nearly every job I've had as an adult. And these jobs often had clauses or regs that allowed for search/seizure of personal property at worksites or during work hours. We were provided with lockers for phones ect., so is OP. Lock it. Its simple. OP said her mom is there, so she isn't the first line of help in a medical emergency. I have 3 men in my family with diabetes, none of which are just dropping like flies on a daily basis. I understand OP concern for her dad, diabetes can be scary with its long term consequences. It would be understandable on RARE occasions to ask a boss to have a cell phone close by FOR THE DAY if things are especially bad, but ask first. People find it so hard to follow the rules. Find work that will allow for cell phones. Get a pager (lol, remember those?) Mom can BEEP OP in the event of an emergency.I served at a moderately upscale restaurant through 5 years of college and I definitely noticed patterns when it comes to tipping...it gets easier with time to tell who your good tippers will be even before you bring the check trust me! Anyway, when it comes to younger people, like those in their teens and early 20s, my experience says you get one of two types: shitty tippers, or great tippers who like yourself work in the service industry Elderly couples usually don't tip much either, but I never faulted them for it as they may be on a fixed income...tip or no they were always my favorite customers worthy of my utmost respect and I provided them with the best service possible! I'm in the US...and another segment of poor tips are from foreigners...possibly because other countries don't follow the tipping model we use here...sorry but truthful, a foreign accent usually indicates a shitty tip There's always some outliers to each scenario of course... Either way I always seemed to walk out with at least $20 per table..put me through expensive state college and provided me with an opportunity to pay my way living off campus Edited to add: As far as being new...don't discuss that unless you have to! It will diminish the customers confidence in you. Walk to every table like you've been serving there for a lifetime! Fake it til ya make it!!I gone through stages of scanning NAMUS for days at a time for years. I've noticed a pattern through the years of large numbers of unidentified bodies being on or near the US/Mexico border. I'm sure in at least some of these cases identification is difficult as the person is not documented. The cases I'm referring to are unidentified, and not homicide victims. Its heart breaking to consider the number of people who try to come to the US only to have their lives taken by drowning or in vehicle accidents etc. And their families thinking they are in the US, safe. The most disturbing to me are the unidentified children like the boy in the box, and those known victims of a serial killer in Alaska. With the Alaska women they know how the died and who killed them, but not their names. 😥We got our 12 yo daughter a ball python for her first snake on her bday, daughter just turned 18 this week and the snake has been a fantastic pet the entire 6 years...very docile doesn't mind being handled (maybe once a week avoiding feeding times) Shes been healthy throughout too with a couple exceptions, difficult to get her to eat when she was new to our home and enclosure, and about a year ago she banged her head on her enclosure causing it to swell...vet did antibiotics as a precaution and she's been fine since! I would wholeheartedly recommend the ball python for a first timer...they're also a ton of fun to watch! Good luck! 🐍The worse part about this is everyone is complaining about the kids creating art and characters for their favorite franchise because they're \"cringy\" and ignore the blatantly predatory people and disgusting content that's everywhere in fandom now Fandoms are just not safe anymore for teens, even if it's a cartoon with an intended audience of children. Especially not, sometimes. Nearly every vocal fandom I was in as a teenager was filled with a LOT of NSFW content and gross ass adults doing messed up shit who knew full well their audience was a bunch of minors. These fandoms were all for franchises that were supposed to be family friendly or otherwise had a large younger audience. Super creepy how some people act once they find a children's cartoon they like.This was on my screen when I returned to a tab opened on my phone. I suspect it was an ad, because the URL for the page I was previously viewing remained unchanged. My guess is that it displayed improperly on my phone and was only meant for desktop users. It covered the entire screen, and was probably cut off. There was animation initially, but I mostly just saw it scroll and move for a while until it finally stopped. The quality was this bad before I took the screenshot. I have no idea what this could be. Any... Ideas? I don't have any guesses what this could be advertising. Maybe some kind of show? To be honest, it's kind of freaking me out because it's entirely indecipherable to me. Come to think of it, though, the red shape on the far right looks like it could be a person. Edit: The first thing the figure on the right reminds me of is Antman. It doesn't *exactly* look like the character either, but it does vaguely look like it has a helmet on. Looking for similar Antman ads has brought me nothing, and I don't think there were any Antman movies to be advertised at that time... Which was like, a week ago. The visible hand on the figure seems to be glowing a little, and looks like it might be holding something?To clarify more, I had a dream that the \"villain\" was in my house, standing in plain sight, yet still strangely hidden. He does that. Chills have kept happening ever since, along with intrusive thoughts of... *Things* being in the room with me. Problem is, in the story, the \"villain\" is not real, per-say. Still, he grows to have a tangible effect on the world the more people grow paranoid of him. Like mass hysteria.... Or more than that. So now I'm paranoid of being paranoid of a fictional character that I am increasingly fleshing out and giving depth too, which is contributing to the paranoia. I wasn't really scared of anything before the dream. It's silly to be scared. He's a fictional character. The room is *really* cold.OCD but.. I decided to not open Christmas gifts in front of my mom and her boyfriend this morning because my mom and her boyfriend can't stop making noises with their mouths, because it triggers my OCD and I enter a psychosis episode lasting from several minutes to several hours. I also didn't go with them to see relatives because I would not be able to take it with them being in their car. I am always trying to hide from them so they don't trigger my OCD I feel like my OCD has been getting worse and worse over the years. Becoming more of a shut-in in fear of my parents triggering my ocd, not socializing as much, continuing to wake up at night and sleep in the day, dark circles under eyes, being more in my head, being more irritable I am only 17 and I don't know if I will develop full blown schizophrenia once I become an adult or in my mid-20s. No longer will it just be OCD and misophonia. Whats even worse is it's believed mine has a cause too. Unhealthy diet which builds up nasty chemicals in my body, a brain autoimmune disease that's triggered when I have strep, and yeast overgrowth, and too much technology, possibly just my addiction or the EMFs.You can give your child allergy tests before vaccinating to be sure no complications may occur. And if a complication does occur, see a doctor, get him or her tested for any infections, if positive, treat the side-infections and just avoid that baccine from now on. It would be smarter though to know which ingredients to avoid and not what vaccines to avoid. Thimerosal is safe in its extremely low levels, and its not even in childhood vaccines anymore, so theres even less of a risk, its really the infections/ear infections/yeast overgrowth etc. that causes children to suddenly change after getting certain vaccines, not “the metals”. This is why many children grow out of their diagnosis or like most people, the side-effects pass after a week or two, because the infections often, but not always, pass after a week or two. And if theres still complications after a few weeks, treat it. If complications happen, which are uncommon, its not autism, the child may just be sick and need treatment for certain complications if its an infection or what not, or an allergy to an ingredient, but its definitely not the mercury or anything like what quacks sayUpdate: I think I fucked up because when riding my bike to Walgreens, I was hoping customer support would help me apply, so when I asked the cashier if there was customer support, she called the manager to help me instead, who was BUSY in the pharmacy section. So the manager came to me from the other side of the store, when I was in my dirty informal coat and shoes when I rode my bike there, and asked him awkwardly, knowing I probably shouldn't've bothered the manager, \"H-how do- i'd like to apply at a job at walgreens\" or something like that. He told me \"Go to jobs.walgreens.com and make sure to choose the correct store\", and that was it. I feel like I wasted his time and how I acted so nervous for bothering him, I think I blew my chance of the manager hiring me. He didn't seem aggravated at me, but I don't know if deep down he was annoyed because he was called down from the pharmacy section because some kid asked him how to apply at walgreen's. Maybe if I wait a month or two to apply, the manager would've forgetten about me.I appreciate you're trying to be helpful, It's just my biggest question is what did I say that suggested that I have porn habits or rely on porn? Was it just because I was ranting about it? I was ranting about it because I didn't understand before why people could possibly enjoy it, but now I know. But look, even when I told you I didn't have porn habits, you still didn't understand/believe me. That's just kind of irritating. Imagine if you told me you didn't play Video Games, but then I said \"okay, I hope you figure it out and stop playing videogames\"People choose this age because it's when parents most likely have jobs established and are settling down by then. Most people don't want to have kids while in college or having financial struggles, and honestly this makes sense. Also, 30s isn't really that old if you know how common it is for parents to have kids at this age. It's not even that risky to have kids in your 30s. What's really a little too old is when you're in your 40s, because that's about when females can no longer procreate and when genetic disorders become more common in offspring.Sometimes wonder why they don't just use their imagination. They get their \"satisfaction\" either way. But honestly, I don't think even masturbating is satisfying. Sure, you came, but then you feel like shit after masturbation. Not really satisfying now is it? With imagination, you can at least forget about it, but when you watch porn, it stays in your mind as a false memory, and it's way too explicit. I feel wierd masturbating to someone else having sex. I can't pretend that person is me, because it isn'tYes, but you need to use some sort of tools, but what I used are very easy to use and find. All you need is MS Paint (GIMP can't save as 8-bit bitmap), Notepad++, a Hex viewer plugin for Notepad++, Windows Calculator, and Common Factors Calculator: https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/commonfactors.php Step 1: - Download Notepad++ and a Hex viewer plugin, and make sure the Hex plugin works. Step 2: - Find out how many bytes are in the program you'd like to visualize. You can either do this by going into Hex view and see the amount of bytes, or go into properties and look at \"Size\", not \"Size on disk\" Step 3: - Go to https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/commonfactors.php and put in \"(number-of-bytes), 1\" in the box, and it will give you all the possible factors. then open Windows Calculator and square-root the number of bytes, then go back to Calculator Soup and find two numbers that are exactly greater and less than the square root. - These steps make it so you can fit the bytes in an almost-perfect square, and not a long and stretched out image. Step 4: - Open up MS Paint and enter the calculated width and height, then use the color, with the RGB code 128, 128, 128 to fill the entire box with. Then save the image as a Bitmap Image and save it as a 256-color bitmap. Step 5: - Open up the bitmap image in notepad++ hex viewer and find the repeating a4 a4 a4 a4 a4 pattern. Select all of that. - Then open the desired program in hex view and copy all of the hex code. Step 6 - Paste the program hex on top of the selected bitmap hex, and then save it. And when you view the bitmap image it should turn from a gray picture to a bunch of arranged lines, dots and shapes, representing the program code in 8-bit pixels/256 color There are so many things people can do with this, like easily comparing program code, easily spotting code patterns. If only I knew how to program these steps so that you can just [Select file] and get the image in a fraction of a second, unfortunately, I don't know how to program. The instructions may be confusing, as I'm not best with verbally expressing myself, but I hope my steps weren't too vauge. If something didn't turn out right and you need help doing this, just ask me and I'll try re-explaining.Are you just saying I'm being over-assuming on what people say and be black/white on things? Like I expect people to understand me, but I don't put enough effort into understanding others, like I assume what they mean before asking what they meant? ..or are you saying my personal beliefs are \"not reality\", saying things you might like I don't like? That I should like porn and if I don't I'm delusional? I hope you meant the first one. I still don't know what you mean, because all I said mostly is how I don't PERSONALLY like it. How is this bad and how am I enforcing my views on others as being the social norm? I will assume you just skin-read for now, because I wasn't \"creating my own reality\" like you claimed I was. I was just stating how it makes me feel.>it seems like you're doing a lot to create your own reality. Are you saying that I assume too much about why people are the way they are and why they think the way they do, rather than hear their position/reasoning first? ...Or are you saying that my personal feelings towards things are wrong, ignorant and \"don't fit reality\"? Also, can you please share some examples of me doing this, so I know what exactly you're talking about, and so I don't have to assume what you meant by your post? You're post is so vague and it seems like you're calling me delusional for not liking things such as porn. <-- worst case scenario I hate misunderstandings because they leave room for negative feelings and thoughts, and vague posts like yours that imply such negative things bother me very much, which is why I prefer when people explain themselves, because then it usually turns out the person didn't have as negative intent as I originally thought. And it seems like you have a misunderstanding of my post history as well. I was simply stating how I feel to it. Is that against reality? I wasn't saying people should feel the same way, I was just trying to understand the other point of view. How is this wrong and \"creating my own reality\"?Sorry for bringing this thread up again, continuing the discussion is not my intention. I was just looking through my replies and saw: >You're thinking about it in a fairly alien way, and also raising very niche concerns. >In some ways it's like you're trying to do a math problem backwards by starting with addition and subtraction then doing the multiplication and then doing the things in parenthesis. So, you're basically saying that your personal feelings are universally right, and that my personal feelings are backwards-thinking? Now that I worded it in this way, now do you see what's wrong with what you said? You called my thinking backwards because you simply don't feel the same way I do, because you like porn and it doesnt bother you because you like it Doesn't make either of us right or backwards. Also, define \"niche concerns\". just say what it means, don't connect them to what I said, so I can just look back and so theres no confusion.Sorry to mention this discussion once again, continuing it from last off is not my intention. but I was just reading all this again and saw >based on your own life experiences Can you also acknowledge that most of the reasons are also just my tastes and the way I am? Not experiences? Because if you read it, only one reason had to do with personal experiences, and you changed it to make it so ALL the reasons are personal experiences when only one was. I mean, understanding personal preferences is hard, but my preferences arent personal experiences.like you claimed, so is it ok if you can admit only one of the seven reasons was based on experience, and that it's hard to understand views that are against your own? Just admit that understanding preferences is hard for you instead of changing it to just personal experiences. Personal tastes, not personal experiences.And that's fine with me if you find my arguments strange, It's just you don't feel the same way that I do, or experience the same feelings I do. Doesn't make it right or wrong, it's just preference and the way we are. Also, it's fine if you don't feel the same way I do. No one here needs therapy or is crazy, we have just developed different tastes through our experiences. If I respect your tastes, can you respect my lack of one? I just don't see porn appealing to me right now, probably because I desire relationships over sex, and I haven't had sex yet fyi. I feel sex is too overwhelming for me right now, so watching sex makes me very anxious. Right now, all I see sex-drive as is you have to masturbate once a day to purge the urges from your mind, but porn only drags those urges into my everyday life for me, when I want feelings of sexual intercourse to go away. I can say for sure, that watching porn before ever having sex is extremely discouraged, because porn is strictly a fantasy and it can mislead you on what sex is really like, for those who never had it. Porn age restrictions are far more important than people realize, because teens don't understand intimacy something porn doesn't show, because teenage brains are underdeveloped and impressionable. Maybe my view of porn will be more relaxed once I get a girlfriend and am older than 17, but I wouldn't gurantee it for sure.Okay, you're right. These were personal experiences. I wasn't thinking before asking why people couldn't see this. What I really meant by it was why people can't understand in general? I mean, this is just one of the reasons I don't like porn. My dad isn't the only reason. I thought of a more logical list. - When I need to simply jerk off, it's wierd watching porn in a logical perspective, that it's only a guy fucking another girl. Instead, we like to pretend we're the ones fucking the girl. but when I fast-forward to only watch the climax, it makes me feel like I jerked off to a rape scene afterwards, resulting in the feeling of shame that \"I would never do this!\". - Usually I stop ignoring that I watched a guy have sex with another girl after I finish masturbating, which is inconvenient. - And what I watched in bed stay in my memory, mostly the rapey scenes and closeups. - Outside of the porn universe, I want interpersonal relationships with women, but what I do in bed to fulfill my once-in-a-while urges can overlap what I think in my everyday life. I don't know if this is the same for you, but it's the case for me. - The simplicity of sex and getting sex shown from porn is unrealistic. This bothers me because even though it's fake, it stays in my memory as \"something I accomplished\" Showing sex in porn is as being infinitely easy is just not how getting sex in the real world really works, so it feels unsatisfying watching it, because it feels forced/fake and doesn't feel earned, but yet is still saved into my memory as an event. - Memories of these rapey scenes can pop up outside of the bedroom and can sometimes intrude everyday thoughts during my everyday life, if someone or something reminds me of them. - Porn builds anxiety for me because it puts me in situations I am unfamiliar with, with little backstory or explanation as to why I'm here. People who are like me like to figure things out, rather than accept the new situation without explanation. Unlike TV, you're not the focus being put in serious situations, you're observing them. - Watching any kind of porn reminds me afterwards that I'm still a virgin and that I just watched someone else have sex, not experiencing the real thing. - Any time other than during masturbation, I like to watch and think about things that can educate me, and since relationships are not an interest to me yet, porn isn't an interest either because you don't need to know any new sex moves for a partner you don't have, so it feels like a waste of time afterwards. They might not be reasons you agree with, but do these improved ones make a bit more sense now? Also, anxiety is found in many normal things, such as being placed in new situations, but honestly, I think I'm just less sexually active at least right now.>It's perfectly possible to a lot of guys, actually. Sucks that isn't the case for you, but maybe you'd prefer reading erotica or listening to something like gonewild audio instead. So, out of curiosity, what do you like out of porn, besides being erotic and arousing of course? But we can all agree porn is just for bedtime right, to suppress those urges, which is why we masturbate? I guess I was taking it way too seriously because I thought you and others meant you liked to watch it more than just once or twice in the day when you're about to go to bed or something.I just want to have sex instead of watching other people do it. I don't want to look at goofy camera angles of peoples penises and vaginas, I want it to be my penis in her vagina, but pretending it's my penis in the video doesn't change that I watched someone else. It gives me cuck feelings. Though solo porn may be better, it still just builds up anxiety and reminds me that it isn't real. Also, It makes me feel like I'm just placed in this situation. I'd rather figure this shit out than just accept im in this situation. I want the real thing.Personally I am fine with seeing sex on a regular tv show or movie, because tv tries to replicate reality on how people get sex. but in porn, it just jumps right into the sex and the focus is specifically sex and no love. The behind the scenes don't help with this either and make it worse for me. I wish sex was made to fit reality. In tv, they try to make sex real, and it usually takes some buildup. In my head, what's sex without love? I may be projecting a bit in these posts, but is it fine if I just find connection and story more interesting than just sexual organs?>But regardless, I don't see what on earth you're talking about, Can you at least be a bit open-minded to understand where I'm coming from here? It's fine these things don't bother you, but not everyone is like you, but it's very rude to call my tastes & personal experiences \"BULLSHIT!\" >but I think most people use it as a pressure relief valve so you can blow one off in a couple minutes and go on with your day And that's great it helps you relieve stress, but for me personally, being put in new situations makes me stressed. >But it sounds like you should totally go talk to a therapist about the dad and mom shit. If that's somehow gotten tied into your sense of sexuality. Okay, maaaybe I am a bit more held back sexually than my peers. I'm only 17 you know. I'm just into more romantic sex, and porn is too fast-paced, spontaneous and casual. It could be your thing, but it's just not my thing. Sex isn't everything to me, I could care less if I'm undersexual. >Also, please consider dropping the term sluts from your vocabulary. Using a pejorative term to insult or hurt a woman who's actually comfortable with her sexuality and sex positive is unhelpful to society and makes you sound like a butthurt little virgin. Perhaps I used the word slut out of context. I was just using the word to describe how I feel, which is caring more about a woman's body more than her character, which Is why I like sex with a connection. To me, character > sex . You seem like a guy who likes sex. And thats GREAT!, but realize everyone's different and not everyone has the same tastes in sex as you do. Nobody is right or wrong for being over or under sexual.These things might not bother everyone, but they bother me, so here's the list: - I feel slutty after watching porn because I've personally been hurt by sluts, like my dad. It hurts to watch it. Watching porn makes me feel like I'm my dad cheating on my mom, and I don't want to hurt anyone like my dad did. - It's too explicit for me. I'd rather use porn as a reference or building blocks for my imagination rather than as a movie you think about. The problem with this is, you already have the building blocks of the female body so it's literally worthless to you now. - It makes me overly anxious rather than relaxed. I mean, come on! It's known some people just aren't adrenaline junkies, you know? - Instead of thinking it's me having sex, I only see two people having sex. I feel like a cuckold. - Casual sex is awkward for me, I'm more into bonding and knowing the person. In porn, you don't know the person and that turns me off. - Porn is instantaneous and relationships build slowly to get to the sex. Porn is too fast-paced and rushed it's uncomfortable. Does this seem understandable? Why are these reasons hard to think of from the other side of the view? EDIT: updtated text and fixed reddit-spacingPeople don't like it apparently, It's like a 60-50% of the population that dislikes it or they see it as an issue. and I so happen to be the internet minority, as the internets made for porn. Well, enough of that, here's a few reasons why I don't like it, and these might not even be problems for you, but for me they are. - It's too explicit for me. I'd rather use porn as a reference or building blocks rather than as a movie you think about. The problem with this is, you already have the building blocks of the female body so it's literally worthless to you now. - It makes me overly anxious rather than relaxed. I mean, come on! It's known some people just aren't adrenaline junkies, you know? - Instead of thinking it's me having sex, I only see two people having sex. I feel like a cuckold. - Casual sex is awkward for me, I'm more into bonding. In porn, you don't know the person and that turns me off. - I feel slutty after watching porn because I've personally been hurt by sluts, like my dad. It hurts to watch it. Watching porn makes me feel like I'm my dad cheating on my mom, and I don't want to hurt anyone like my dad did. Why is this hard to see?Okay, I see your point. What I mean is yes, I do criticize their addiction, but then they will call you religious because you don't support it. And they will constantly try to get you hooked even when you told them you don't like it. Me: \"I don't like it\" Addict: \"ooh come on try it\" Me: \"I already tried it, I don't like it\" Addict: \"ooh come on man try it. You just didnt find the right one\" You see how irritating this conversation can be? He willl ignore everything you say and only cares about getting you hooked.I already told you I had a negative reaction to a vaccine which lasted for years. So why are you still encouraging me to take it? You're being nothing but a fucking asshole trying to peer-pressure someone who's half of their life was damaged because of a vaccine. I know you don't understand because like I said before, you haven't lived my life, but you won't listen to me and are just yelling at me about how stupid I am. You have to realize my story probably happens to 1 in a hundred thousand kids. I was not taught to hate vaccines, I hate them because of my experience If you're telling me I should die because I, one single person, won't take a vaccine because of a traumatizing experience, Go fuck yourself you son of a bitch.If it was as simple as being right or wrong, vaccines wouldn't be a controversial topic. Don't get me wrong, I don't think vaccines themselves contribute to brain dysfunction, I believe the preservatives do. Example: Thimerosol: -2001 and many others long ago The only problem I have with vaccines is 1, the virus can rarely be active and 2, with the history of the FDA allowing dangerous preservatives in vaccines, why wouldn't they make the same mistake again? If I were ever to take a vaccine, I would get preservative-free./u/RealityTimeshare just posted this ITT >Prior to introduction of thimerosal in the 1930's, data were available in several animal species and humans providing evidence for its safety and effectiveness as a preservative (Powell and Jamieson 1931). Since then, thimerosal has been the subject of numerous studies (see Bibliography- Notable Studies and Assessments Supporting the Safe Use of Thimerosal in Vaccines) and has a long record of safe and effective use preventing bacterial and fungal contamination of vaccines, with no ill effects established other than minor local reactions at the site of injection. Sure, an adult might be able to handle thimerosal, but less likely would an infant Also, I have a genetic disorder which makes it harder for me to process metals which is referred to as a methylation problem. So no, I would be less tolerable to the once mercury-based preservative. But you have to think, just because the average person can just process the preservative that was banned since 2001, what about the minority that can't flush it out of their system like me? Especially if they're infants getting their first MMR or vaccination?Again, I'm only saying Thimerosal is bad, I don't have any other knowledge of the other preservatives being used, but I hear parents still report their children \"getting autism\" soon after their first vaccines From knowledge: > The FDA banned Thimerosal from vaccines in 2001. It was likely banned because it is a mercury-based preservative, and that they were being notified that their children \"got autism\" several days-week after the vaccine From experience >A week after having an MMR in 2000, I had a seizure IMMEDIATELY after the MMR. I was rushed to the emergency room and the doctors diagnosed me with autism. >My parents knew this couldn't be a coincidence, for almost a year, they went to see fighting-autism specialists, and we found one, a lady asked if I had a MMR. My parents said yes and the specialist suggested that these symptoms were likely caused by a preservative named Thimerosal. >The specialist offered chelation. After about 5-6 years of chelation, I was no longer labeled as autistic. And autism doesn't go away through age. you keep it your whole life. So the MMR had something to do with it. If it didn't get chelated however, I probably would still be labeled as autistic to this day and probably wouldn't know what Reddit is.Okay, first of all, I'm sorry for that last post I made. I kind of sounded like an asshole there, instead of trying to justify myself. Secondly, I would like to ask, what isn't convincing? The vague statement that vaccines cause autism-like symtoms, or that Thimerosal, a preservative that was put in vaccines, specifically MMRs to keep it resistant to outside germs, which one of the elements used in the Thimerosal Molecule Ethylmercury, up until 2001, when the FDA decided it should not be put in vaccines anymore, because it was reported to have negative side affects among infants?. Why would they all of the sudden remove Thimerosal from vaccines? There was obviously problems with it, but the FDA didn't admit that they were putting a potentially toxic chemical into vaccines. It would cost hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuits. You think the FDA is just going to say \"Yeah, we fucked up, sorry.\"? No, they're going to do what benefits themselves. They removed it, yes, but they didn't admit it was bad. Don't get me wrong, the idea of vaccinations is brilliant. I am not against the concept, as long as the disease in the vaccine is inactive and doesn't infect the patient. What I am against is the PRESERVATIVES they put in vaccines. Are you saying doctors and medical staff research for 8+ years to see if Thimerosal is safe? I can't say for sure, but I think the doctors back before 2001 made this chemical which made vaccines stay clean longer, To sum this post up, I don't think doctors are still defending Thimerosal today. Maybe two decades ago but it's over now.This is almost a year ago I think. Okay, thimerosal isn't in the vaccines anymore. I did have a vaccine before Thimerosal was removed from them. Sure, Thimerosal isn't in vaccines anymore, but who knows what else the FDA could be putting into our vaccines. The FDA labels additives in food that are toxic in large quantities to be safe, so why wouldn't they make the same mistakes for vaccines? Also, flu shots might still have Thimerosal in them, idk, but I do know some of them are imported from other countries, which may allow such preservatives like the thimerosal.I'm sorry I had a temper tantrum a couple hours ago. I deleted the post and we can just forget about that ok? Look, I have ADHD and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and in order to cope with intrusive thoughts like this discussion, I need to understand the full situation, but you keep using words and phrases that can have multiple meanings to them, and it's hard to understand the messages behind your posts. The things I would like explaining are: >ok man it looks like there is no changing your mind, good luck looking for like minded people. i would suggest religion subreddits i don't think you'll find many people that agree with your view points on mainstream subs. I find this post a bit uncalled for. All I said is that porn doesn't benefit to ME. how does that have anything to do with not changing my mind? Yes, I know you said: >stop worrying what others are doing and work on yourself. i cant get any clearer then this. ..but that had nothing to do with what I was saying before. It also seems like you keep denying that I just don't like how porn makes me feel. First you say \"So it's not for you \"\"right now\"\"\", then you tell me the reason why I don't like porn is because society is enforcing me to hate it. Why can't you just accept the fact that it's not my thing? What are you trying to change my mind about? To like the exact same things you do? You're telling me it's ok to like/dislike things AND to like the exact same things you do. It's either one or the other dude.>because if porn upsets you recreational drugs will too I son't see how these two are related. Sure, society standards and some political ideologies are against both, but if you disregard that, they are completely different. > society and religion will shape you to be the most productive human to benefit society but not yourself, Were you just referring to just trying new things like cannabis and hallucinogenics? Ok, I can see weed benefiting some people, but I just can't benefit myself from porn, sorry. You don't have to do things that are against society or religion's 'moral standards'. You can read a book, play videogames, watch a TV series you like, do something outdoors, any kind of hobby, no hobby is restricted to a taboo. In my opinion, you don't have to agree, but I don't find society/majority to be an oppressive force and that the society and religion are meant to make us the most productive humans to benefit society SO we can benefit ourselves.You say don't let society determine what you like/dislike, but you see, society isn't influencing my opinions on things like porn. Do you think there's something wrong with me if I don't find enjoyment out of watching porn? I always feel anxious and upset whenever I remember the porn scenes I watched/looked at in the past. Do these intrusive memories bother you at all? I know some people who don't find enjoyment out of weed either, and it makes them feel paranoid. I've never tried weed, but assuming through heredity, I won't.I was raised non-religious and I still don't like it. Is there any other reason besides religion that I feel this way? Some extra details is that when I was younger like 14, I used to have a more relaxed view on pornography like you seem to, 'because it was new to me at the time.' Now, after seeing which I would guess to be almost a hundred of these types of these videos, it's just not interesting to me anymore and I find it quite prude and disgusting now. [ ! ] You and others asked me a lot of questions, let me ask you some. What's left in these films that you are trying to explore? You already know what the female body and sex looks like, so why continue exploring? Do you seek more from these films? Because let me tell you from my experience, all I find is dissatisfaction now.Sorry I'm making an additional reply. >Morals are what you make them, or make of them What does this saying mean? I make morals? I'm not good with sayings like this. >Morals are what you make them, or make of them. Being unfaithful to whom? Yourself? Porn is just like anything else in life: It can be fun to enjoy in moderation I'm also having trouble understanding this post. Are you saying I should go against my morality? This is starting to sound like peer-pressure. It probably isn't what you meant, but if it isn't, what did you mean by it? . EDIT: ------------------------------------------------------------- Also, it's not that I'm afraid of it being a habit, I just don't like it and how it makes me feel. What makes me upset is you guys treat this like it's a strange phenomenon like there's something wrong with me. And I said porn is immoral, not sex. (for the most part at least) ----------------------------------------------------------->So just because your dad cheated on your mom or had sex after a divorce was finalized, you let this affect your sex life which at 17 is merely just beginning, I'll admit it affects my views on sex somewhat, not really my sex-life though,.The things that affect my sex-life have to do with other things. I don't know if you were referring to just sex-life or sex-life and views on pornography, because I don't think I'll ever go back to pornography, whether my sex life is strong or weak. >Morals are what you make them, or make of them. Being unfaithful to whom? Yourself? Kind of, yeah. I'm watching a stranger naked and \"playing with herself\". What I find worse is watching her having sex with aniother man on camera. I feel kind of unfaithful after doing that, and kind of a pervert getting aroused by or witnessing another man banging a woman. >Porn is just like anything else in life: It can be fun to enjoy in moderation, It's interesting for me in the moment, but then I regret it immediately after I'm out of the sexual-trance. Even when I'm in the moment nowadays I just stick to my imagination for the most part. >You're still young and got a long road ahead in life, constantly learning about the world and life. Try not to think about this too much and let it eat at you. You're right, I have lots more to learn in life as a whole, How to manage relationships in the future, how to take care of myself, but in the realm of porn? nope! That's why I ask questions, so it doesn't eat at me. \"The more you know!\"I agree with the statement that age and experience can change your way of thinking. I just don't think this applies to porn. I don't believe embracing porn is a step-up in maturity. If anything it's related to midlife crisis. I read stories that once people quit porn, they never wanted to go back. Sure, knowing what sex is & how to handle it in relationships is an advancement, but I don't think just plain watching it for masturbation-material is. And learning it through porn is nowhere near as good as learning it through your own personal experiences in relationships. Unless something drastic changes my life or personality, changing my view on porn would be like changing my political views.I am 17 and I'm a male. I am conservative, but I don't think that matters much. Idk why it upsets me, it's just not right to me. it's un-natural to watch someone else \"do it\". It's fake if I may. Sure, I understand for most it's an escape from real life and you can pretend YOU are the one doing the stuff, but after you ejaculate, at least for me, you realize that it isn't you, and you watched a heartless film on pornhub/xvidoes/xhamster/xxnx etc. Every film is the same. Some guy picks up a slut in his limo or the slut rings the doorbell, then the girl sucks his dick and then the guy fucks her. It's all the same, and it's fake and un-real.First of all, to be fair, you are right about vaccines not causing autism, BUT vaccines can cause autism-like symptoms for a minority of people. I must say first, most people can handle vaccinations, I have to give you that. They get the vaccine, and they dispose of the bad chemicals used to preserve them. Some people however cannot handle the preservatives in vaccines, just like some people can't tolerate milk or peanuts. Instead of disposing of them, they stay in their body and cause problems in the human body, particularly the brain. One of the common preservatives in vaccines is Thiomersal, which is composed partially of Mercury (Hg) elements. As I said before, some people can handle it and flush it out of their bodies, other times and the worst cases, it messes with people's brain-development. The reason you don't hear every case of vaccines causing autism often is because not everyone is affected by it. If anything I said was incorrect here, feel free to let me know, I'm open to all thoughts. :)I understand what you're saying, and now that I think about about it more, there is more than just one type of popular. There can be those kind of popular people who help people out and are nice, but they don't let anyone else push them around. Then theres the other kind who are generally athletic, good-looking, and hang out with large elite social groups full of men & women. The part that makes these people popular and draw attention is their alphaness, and their controvertial behavior. They are strong, and noone can put them down, and that's why they draw attention, because they are considered the \"tough guys\" and all the girls are drawn to them.i don't know. For the past 4 years 99.8% of my time on 2b2t was me at spawn talking in chat, and i probably did that for a total of 500 hours on 2b2t. The 0.2% was when i left spawn. I made it out easily, it just got boring being thousands of blocks away from civilization and I only built if anything small stone huts and a small farm. I would eventually either lose my home from a bed-glitch/creeper breaks my bed, or I get bored and break my bed, do /kill and be back at my home. Even with spawn being 100x more griefed than pre-june spawn, It's still easy as all hell leaving, I'm just too lazy to leave because theres nothing productive to do on 2b2t.I WILL PROVE IM AN OLDFAG!!!! - My alts are Zionist, Kirbinator_ , Notcn, Chris_ Chan_ , 420mlg - James_Rustle's alt is NigerianSpearman - Pyrobyte's spawn withers were named \"Pyrobyte is king vivat vex\" - thePOMPANO used to talk in all caps - Sato86's alt is Melkor91 - jared2013's alt is D4RKJ0E - hurc is an oldfag - Pyrobyte's alt is Cryobyte - Anonam00se used to play alot in 2014/2015, but hardly plays anymore - Sato86's old skin from 2013 used to have swasticas on his arms - alien803 joined in 2014 - In 2012, spawn used to have netherrack pillars all over spawn and wasn't completely lavacasted - 2b2t was originally a 4chan serverNo, if enough players donate, then Hause can upgrade to better hardware if he wanted to, and better hardware means more RAM which means hause can promise all these things. Also, I know the TPS was shit back then because only 15-20 players played then and most didn't bother donating, but now Hause can convince THOUSANDS of little kids to donate for his server. This is why Hause has been trying to push donations recently, because now he has thousands of little kids who have access to mommy's paypal and will donate if Hause offers something like better server hardware, which can also be translated to higher tps, uptime and higher view distance.Wheres your sources and evidence faggot? To me it just looks like you're making assumptions. I want to see some fucking EVIDENCE! You can post the evidence in this thread, you can private message me it, I just want to see it, and no, \"hur durr you have no items\" or \"you act like a noob\" is a not a valid reason. You need to give me reliable sources like chat logs or something like that. (No, they don't HAVE to be chat logs, but you get my point.) EDIT: I'm sorry, I just get so mad when people make such ridiculous statements about me. But still, can I see some evidence? Otherwise it just looks like you're lying and making stuff up.He keeps ignoring me and my alts on Constantiam simply because I'm SuperKirbzz and tells everyone on the server to ignore me. He ignores me even when I'm not spamming or shitposting, and he thinks It's funny when he ignores me too. If I slip up and talk like my normal self on my alts by accident, he'll say in chat, \"He's SuperKirbzz!\" \"Ignore him!\". He doesn't ignore any other player on the server, just me. I'm the only person he HAS to ignore every time I use my alts. I ask him why he has a problem with me on my other alts, and he doesn't answer my question, laughs, and ignores me again. He said the only way he will unignore me is if I don't play on the server for a whole month, but I think he's lying through his teeth. Either he just likes trolling people TO THE FUCKING EXTREME or he legitimately hates me. It's hard to tell.FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE) FUCK YOU BALONYPONY AND CRATEOFBOXES (ESPECIALLY YOU CRATE)i think it's a generalization based on late June and July. back then the toxicity was genuinely bad, but since then, especially on twitter, things have improved so much. i don't remember the last time dttwt, like the fanbase itself not dream, had a big scandal (after the schlatt thing in July) and yet we get the most hate, especially here on reddit yes there are youtube fans who are just kids, and don't understand the concept of friendly rivalries like dream and techno have, but these kind of people are in every fanbase we honestly get too much shit for not doing anything and at this point I'm just getting pissed off about it tbhdue to the changes mcc announced i‘m actually doubting just a little bit their guaranteed win. i assume they will win, it‘s very likely, but I‘m not as sure anymore. We have no idea about the dynamic the team will have since we haven‘t had ine training stream w them together, we don‘t even know if they prepared together at all. Iassumed they would definetely train together, but Dream even forgot Burrens name, which probably wouldn‘t happen if they trained together. idk, i think they will most likely win but it isn‘t guaranteed imoThis is why this two-party system is extremely flawed imo. I know this rant is about the people, but no wonder most people think extreme if you have to choose between two extremes. Where I live are the 5 main parties, but we have like 10+ parties to vote for. Of course, there are some parties that are a bit too left or a bit too right, but you have alternatives. If someone tells me they who voted for I might find their decision odd but it won't create a huge argument (unless they vote for the extreme right, they should be forbidden). Every election we decide who to vote for by their recent actions and politics, normally we don't stay loyal to one party, we just look who actually got shit done. Imo the two-party system guarantees people to hate the other side, just because it's just in the nature of people to be opposed to the exact opposite. And in the US you only have the complete opposite and people who don't vote, which also sucks.The accident of Samuel Koch on live, national television. In 2010 there was a game show in Germany called \"Wetten, dass...\". Basically people bet that they can do certain things like, recognize the animal from the smell of the poop or other ridiculous things. Sometimes the show got a little risky, but it all went well until the 4th of December 2010. Samuel Koch bet that he could do a frontflip with special jumping shoes over 5 cars in like 4 minutes. The first three went well (he stopped before one and didn't jump but nothing happened). In the fourth car (his dad driving) he butchered his landing and landed flat on his stomach with the speed of roughly 25mkh (\\~15mph), he didn't get up again. The host immediately ran over to him and called for doctors, the camera was on the crowd as he was treated bc and everyone was shocked, some even cried quietly. Eventually, the people began shouting to take the camera off the ongoing treatment and the host nervously confirmed it wasn't on the patient and then asked the production crew what to do. They showed a short clip and eventually the show was stopped for the evening completely. Samuel Koch broke his neck 4 times and he was paralyzed from his shoulders down, he damaged his carotid artery and spinal marrow. The show didn't last for very long (at least I stopped watching, it was completely canceled in 2014) after that bc they were (understandibly) scared to take risks. I watched it with just 6 years old on live television, it was hella scary. My mom turned it off quickly, but I still spent in my parents' bed that night. For anyone who wants to see it, [here,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMmN3TGKavo&t=421s) the bet starts shortly after the one minute mark and the accident happens shortly after the 3 minute mark. At the end is the accident from another perspective.We talked a lot about South Africa in my English class this year. We mostly looked at your culture first, then your colonial history, for some reason sports, crime rates and unemployment. In the end, we watched \"Tsotsi\". We were quite honestly shocked about the crime rates. It was crazy for us to imagine these numbers. We also talked about apartheid a lot, I remember especially the text \"a schoolboys memories\" about an uprising in Soweto on June 16th in 1976. I'll have to admit when our teacher asked if we would want to live in South Africa, I didn't want to. As a young, white woman I feel like I wouldn't be safe, after seeing the numbers. That may be prejudiced of me, maybe it is quite different than I perceived it, but maybe it isn't.Hey! This is already really good and what you wrote is not wrong, but my recommendation should make it sound a bit more natural. Instead of >\"Ich habe braune Haare und ich habe braune Augen.\" You could leave the second \"ich habe\" weg, as the verb was already established. >Ich habe braune Haare und braune Augen. Or you could even leave the second \"braune\" weg: >Ich habe braune Haare und Augen. None of these things are mistakes, but you would rarely come across a german repeating \"ich habe\" like that. My second recommendation (leaving the second \"braune\" weg) makes it a bit more casual and again is not a mistake. Besides that, I would maybe replace \"komme\" with \"fahre\", which is again just a choice of words that make the text a bit more natural. But you should put the \"gerne\" in front of the \"Basketball\" and should start \"bus\" with an uppercase B. Besides that, I think your text is really good, great job!I killed a wild bird once. I was in the forst and found a bird. It had a broken neck and it looked like it was suffering(panting, neck was turned and twisted in a way I can't even begin to think how that happened and one wing was partially ripped of). I had nothing with me to take it to a vet (if I had a bag or something I would've carried it to a lokal vet about an hour away from where I was) and I was scared of it biting me or catching deceases. I had heard of euthanising and asked a friend if it was the right thing to do. He shrugged and said he thought so. With a lot of doubts I wanted to make it as painless as possible, so I grabbed a stone and smashed the poor things head in. It didn't even make a sound and I cried to whole way back to my house, bird blood on my hands and shirt. I was traumatized even though my parents told me I did the right thing an in an attempt to honour the poor thing I build a small memorial and put it to the same place we burrowed out hamsters at.Pfand. I was shocked it is not common everywhere. Basically, on a lot of bottles you pay 25ct extra that you get beck when you return the bottles to a collecting-machine (?) which you can find about everywhere. You then can either demand money back or get the money you'd get back as a discount. And if you are too lazy to return and don't think these 25ct matter, it you place the bottles next to a trash can as there sadly are people depending on Pfand. By placing the bottle next to the trash can they don't have to search it to find your bottle. It helps make everything cleaner and some people can get some extra money by collecting the bottles.When I was 13 I started texting with some dude I met on Instagram. He was 18 and already finished with school and he seemed amazing to a 13-year-old. He was the first one I told about my mental health issues as I trusted him a lot. We texted every day for months and he eventually broke up with his gf (who was 14) to be with me. The thing is, I wasn't stupid. I didn't tell him the rather small town I lived in but a bigger city near my small town. So, when I trusted him more I somehow had to get out of that lie and told him I moved back to my hometown. He wanted to meet. Suddenly I felt weird. We had never even called each other at that point and it was getting weird. I broke off contact just at the beginning of this year by telling him (now 21, I'm 15) that it was pretty weird for him to have girlfriends this much younger than himself. I was actually in love with him and felt sad when I broke off contact but I was over it quickly so I guess I was just happy that any man was paying attention to me. I never told my parents about it, and I especcially never told them that he had our adress because he sent gifts to me (which is how I found out he used a fake name to text with me. He said it was a nickname when I asked but the more I think about everything he texted me, the more I am glad I never agreed to meet him and broke off contact).85-90% of my city was destroyed two months before the end of WWII, but for some reason my town has a lot of old buildings. A [Fürstbischöfliche Residenz](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wuerzburg/5814106621) (prince bishop residence, this is also the \"castle\" which was used in the movie \"[three musketeers](https://assets.cdn.moviepilot.de/files/cddcd45738e7aff8da056d281cecb4c654b3ede4e0b7e9891a78055ebda8/fill/1080/518/the-three-musketeers-094%28www.Wallpapers76.com%29.jpg)\"), the [Festung Marienberg](https://www.schloesser.bayern.de/bilder/schloss/wu_marienberg450.jpg) (Fortress Marienberg), [\"das Käppele\"](https://www.flickr.com/photos/wuerzburg/5814106621) (a Chapel which has a dark history but looks beautyful tbh), several very old churches ( some people call it \"[the city of churches](https://www.hrs.de/hotel/unterwegs/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/W%C3%BCrzburg_iStock_000020894256Small.jpg)\") and an old bridge which was used for a \"famous\" painting (\"[Würzburger Totentanz](https://wuerzburgwiki.de/w/thumb.php?f=Lenz_Wolfgang_Wuerzburger_Totentanz_1970.jpg&width=800)\" = \"Würzburgs dance of the dead\" in germany and became a \"memorial\" that something like WWII should never happen again. Yeah our city is pretty historical and old... It is actually quite beautyful if you avoid the wrong regions.Social Media made things worse. Sure. But it's just a communication tool. That's my argument. It's like a telephone. Someone is trying to call Hitler to strike a Nuclear Gas bomb But you can also call Madam Teresa to send help to africa or some shit. &#x200B; There's a nuclear strike, and you blame the telephone. Or you think it's \"part of the problem\". Is it really? &#x200B; Better Help and other Mental Health Institutes uses social media for their marketing, to reach more people, to reach more awareness. Charity Organizations are on social media. Is social media really the issue here? &#x200B; Like I said the good comes with the bad, we connect faster to people, and there are good people and there other shitty ones making our existence worse. &#x200B; It's just a different playing field, we don't have to downgrade our technology just because of some fucking assholes. I'm aware the internet and social media are separate things, but those are the major platforms that people are on.I agree with most of these points except one The \"Don't scream like an ad\" point. Stop bullshitting people. It's an Ad! So just admit to being one. If you frame it like some of your friend's post then people will scroll pass it by. It's all about \"Market Messaging/Communication\" and \"Value proposition\" The ad should say something like: \"Hi, I'm not here to fucking waste your time. This is what I offer and I targeted you because you would seem to be interested in it\" You'd be surprised how effective this is for me.Nothing is ever 100% harmless. You can say watching TV is a harmless drug, or porn, junk food, etc. If something gets you high or feel extremely good, us humans will naturally be more drawn to that particular thing. It takes a certain level of mental strength and discipline from a person, to control himself to not get addicted on such things. And not everyone has that. Especially for something strong like a dopamine shot. In my conclusion, if we can invent -like you said- a dopamine shot, but also induce a feeling of \"I don't need to again right away\", like some sort of special hormone or chemical that release that so you won't get the urge to take it again and again, and be addicted to it. Lmao, it's a fascinating idea tho.We should adapt the Turkish language system and remove every pronouns. I just learned about this today, I am learning turkish. How the Turkish Language is different from the English language It uses a universal pronoun. O içiyor He/She is drinking. O is gender neutral. It doesn't signify masculine or feminine. I think it's perfect and brilliant. No more \"micro-aggressions\" by incorrectly using someone's wrong pronoun. No more She/Her, He/Him, They/Them, Ze/Zey, none of that complicated stuff. And I know some people may get offended by this, but that's the point. Use gender neutral pronouns, similar to TurkishTo be fair, Korey was right about pointing that other guy from the last stream. That guy in the chat wasn't paying attention. &#x200B; I think it's great that Korey interacts with the chat or the twitch fans. Some people are just going to be a dick or troll and Korey's actually getting better with ignoring them than he used to. But sure most of the time I wish Korey would just move the show along. &#x200B; Hearing him looking directly at the camera, directly looking at me and saying \"fuck you\" even tho I know he's talking about somebody is getting tiring lolOh man. The internet is nothing but weird things. Nothing but weird fucking things by weird fucking people or just have a weird sense of humor. But the one thing that stuck with me and I could definitely say it's the weirdest fucking video I have ever seen. It's beyond disturbing. &#x200B; I think it's an art piece. It's an animation collage of the just the weirdest/sickest/goriest/things you can imagine. I can go into detail but I really don't want to. I can say that it \"crosses boundaries\" It's not live-action or \"real\", it's all animated graphically made. I just think what kind of sick fuck who would take the time to make it.Let's stop exaggerating our points here. I won't exaggerate yours while you stop exaggerating mine. I'm not suicide-worrying nor moping, I literally just said I want simple conversations. But I am passionate. Is that wrong? &#x200B; Great. So we've identified the problem. It's these corporations that are doing most of the harm to our environment and ecosystem. &#x200B; Yeah you're right. Me alone can't solve this issue. But I'll damn support the other person or group who will. And having these types of conversations will help people know about these things better.\\*Sigh. It's true tho. Just because I said it's a simple process doesn't mean it's not hard. I'll give you that. It's like a straight line, but that line is not easy to cross. Or you get a clear vision of the path but the path still has spiky rocks. And in order to cross that path you need to pay for some special shoes I can see the path, but I just need more resources. &#x200B; Here's some articles and references to judge yourself: [https://goinstagram.com/influencer-500k-instagram-money/](https://goinstagram.com/influencer-500k-instagram-money/) [https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-influencers-get-paid-on-instagram-tiktok-and-youtube-2021-7](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-influencers-get-paid-on-instagram-tiktok-and-youtube-2021-7) [https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-influencers-earn-examples-2021-6](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-instagram-influencers-earn-examples-2021-6) [https://www.petalcard.com/blog/money-instagram-influencer-make](https://www.petalcard.com/blog/money-instagram-influencer-make) [https://www.gobankingrates.com/net-worth/celebrities/top-10-richest-tiktok-influencers/](https://www.gobankingrates.com/net-worth/celebrities/top-10-richest-tiktok-influencers/) * Here's an example * **Riyaz Aly: $2 Million** * The 18-year-old influencer is an Indian internet celebrity, fashion blogger and TikTok influencer known for his lip syncs.

Re-read my post. My tone was fairly neutral. &#x200B; Are you offended that I asked \"Is Snapchat still a thing?\" Jesus. &#x200B; What's happening is you're projecting how you think it sounds like, without actually * You're projecting * you're insecure * and worst of all you're a hypocrite. Listen how you started sounding to come across >Raising an Eyebrow... Bunch of data driven marketers in here, am I right? > >...while you come here and ask 17 year old ... You're not a sparkly-clean humble modest angel, yourself. Jesus you're a hypocrite, reflect. &#x200B; Jesus... trying to have a professional argument about this and you took it personally. And you call yourself a \"professional\".>I'll be honest with you, if this is your \"strategy\", it sounds like you don't really have one, but rather a list of tactics you want to try. It's a strategy. It's not the entire strategy, obviously. A 20% Testing is part of a strategy, is it not? Yes we got touchpoints, objectives, etc. I'm just gathering general opinions here. >A strategy starts with an objective that you are attempting to achieve, and then distilling that down in to specific goals. You're just overcomplicating a simple process. Tbh, that's what most of the marketing field is imo. \"The market dictates what it wants to pay attention to.\" That's it. A kid with no marketing strategy can just play around with social media, can gather just as much if not more followers than these \"professionals\". Find out where the market attention is, and place yourself in it. EDIT: \\*A bit of research help too So yeah, I'll check out Snapchat lmaoThat's a case basis. Sure, everyone has different immunity. But it's about managing and weighing out risks. If you have a legitimate concern, like health wise and underlying issues. Then speak about it. If there isn't, then just take the damn shot. I see people who are willfully ignorant about it, I feel the frustration. Which is truly more risky? Who is causing more harm than good? That is the question. I see Korey's point, but I see your point as well. There can be a middle ground. Everyone wants this covid thing to be done.1. **Only debate/argue about things you truly know about.** 2. **Keep your cool.** 3. **Defeat them with you logic & reasoning.** That's it. Whenever they throw an insult or a fallacy at you, you're done. You already won that argument whenever the opponent turns childish. Just keep your cool & truly know what you're talking about. Only debate about things you truly know about. Accept defeat if you're wrong and move on. Edit: Oh and for articulating, just read a lot. You gotta expand your vocabulary. But really, simplicity is all you need when you have the facts on your side.Lmao you came back, I knew you're not as stoic as you think. Also christ man, I said a thing about forgiveness. You forget or think that I don't know these things, but I do. >I am a forgiving person. Sometimes it's not a person that I'm frustrated at, it's a specific circumstance. Hey where's the part where I said \"I hate and I'm bitter towards people\"? Where's that reply I'm waiting for. &#x200B; >And do you know what happens to people who don't change their opinions about their wives when their best friend fucks her? Change my opinion about them? I can forgive them and move on. But imagine **justifying** your wife cheating on you. The **self-respect just poof \\*gone\\*** Try to question **YOUR** belief for once, like I question mine. Keep making yourself delusional with your \"beliefs\", man. Nice insult, **15-year-old boy**, such a proud stoic.You're not understanding anything at all. I did not say I hate or I'm bitter at anyone. I said that I'm frustrated. That could be you projecting that on me. &#x200B; >No, your emotions are how your beliefs manifest in your conscious mind. I'm not disagreeing with you on that. You're just adding more steps. &#x200B; >No, you claim it's that because your objective is to refuse to change, and claiming this is what Stoicisn says let's you ignore its advice. Listen to what you are saying. If I did change my belief, that would not change the truth. Changing my beliefs would make me delusional just to make myself feel better. I would rather suck it up than do that to myself. Have some goddamn respect for yourself. **If I did change my beliefs, it will not change the truth. I would rather suck it up.** You know what, feelings come and go anyway. The frustration passed, and I handled it better than I thought. Again: I'm not painting a full picture. It's my problems I don't wanna share. So I can't do anything about that and how you want to look at it. That last comment of mine was making peace with you and laying some level ground with you. But you just had to misunderstand and exaggerate my points. Ironic.You're not making this easy for me. Even though I understand where you are coming form. I know what emotions does to the mind, it makes us think irrational and feel entitled. I like to think that I'm none of those things. In hindsights, I can judge myself whether I have been. I am not altering anything. And I refuse to alter or fabricate anything. All of those you accuse me. And I refuse to change my beliefs because I know what is. If I'm wrong on something, then I'll happily change it. But I get it. I'm not painting a full picture. It's my problems I don't wanna share. So I can't do anything about that and how you want to look at it. I get it. Stoicism is just a fancy way of saying \"Suck it up\"My beliefs? What's the line between a belief and just what is? You know \"it is what is it.\" What IS and how I ought to view it? So is the concept of justice all just perspective and beliefs, not what is? This is when a person actually committed acts upon me. I am a forgiving person. Sometimes it's not a person that I'm frustrated at, it's a specific circumstance. What is being righteous and what is just is? I feel emotions. I'm having trouble controlling said emotions. A belief? I only believe in what it is. I am not selfish with my beliefs. It's easier said than done pal, when you're at the bottom of the hole and you're looking down at me from up there.I'm not vilifying the people, god help the people. They're just looking for purpose. I'm vilifying religion itself, indoctrination, sacrilege, and all the lies and ignorance that comes from it. Stop justifying the fucking monstrosity! And I'm not just talking about you per se. There are better ways to be a better person and to help others. That's the whole fucking point is it not? If you're only religious just for the promise to go to heaven, then it's not genuine. There is a possibility that God exists, but it's not how we perceive him. He allows cruel and heinous and a lot of injustice in the world, and I am sick of hearing Catholics saying \"It's all part of his plan.\" Will you please stop justifying this shit! I love people! I love being a good person! I love helping others! But I don't respect religion in the slightest!!Neither. It doesn't perform better based on whether it's on the learning phase, or learning limited. It performs better when you identify your winning variables, then you scale & optimize. The learning phase optimizes and so does Learning Limited. It only says learning limited because your adset is unable to make 50 conversions/events per week which is actually normal for most businesses. Just keep testing and analyzing, scale what works. Do your research. Also don't forget you're advertising to people. Some days you get sales, some you don't. Facebook's Machine Learning Algorithm is doing the best it can.I would much rather believe in an afterlife. Because why should I worship a God that allows heinous and cruel monstrous things happen to the world? And why shouldn't I question his existence? Why is it okay for him to allow millions to suffer, but drag me to hell just to question him? I don't blame religious people to look for purpose, but with the hypocrisy and the fucked up things the Catholic Church has done with the years of child molestation and cover ups... It really makes you feel like not giving a shit.You brought up interesting questions. Very philosophical too. If someone who is alive and being \"screwed over\", that would be considered unfair and injustice. Would you agree with that? It's fine for a westerner tattoo artist to tattoo yin-yang symbol. It's fine for Walmart to sell Buddha-statues. All of that is fine. When a \"culture\" is too big and nobody is getting hurt, then I wouldn't call that culture appropriation. Or maybe even categorize it as \"Acceptable to Unacceptable Culture Appropriation\" It's these people who throw the word \"Culture Appropriation\" around over innocent things and tries to cancel those that gets on my goddamn nerve. They're the ones who are causing more problems and disruption in society.>Freedom of speech doesn't apply to businesses. No it should apply. It's customer feedback. Users have the right to say about what they think of the product. Granted, on social media it's not always the nicest way. Businesses already has the right to block or ban anyway. Removing the dislike is just clearly manipulative, but fine, it's Youtube's platform. >Especially in an era where youtube comments are literally filled with bots just repeating eachother and non bot comments get auto removed, downvotes on a video can be really helpful for determining if the video is actually good This is actually a good point there. But why not focus on getting that fixed instead?Here's my argument I understand why you would feel uncomfortable with that, initially. Whatever you're feeling will always be valid, but let's understand the situation better. He's **marrying** **you!** He's in good terms with his ex, and chooses a friendship with her. It doesn't have to be of any malice. You don't have to view it in any negative way. It could be a beautiful thing, where there is no jealousy or disrespect involved. It could be a very respectful way of having past loved ones celebrating love and friendship. That's how I view it. And I hope you'd understand this perspective. Since everyone is so quick to put up pitchforks in this subreddit. Now to play Devil's Advocate, Would be to ask yourself, has your fiancé been stepping boundaries with his ex? Have you notice any signs? Then that's where you're absolutely right to be worried. But if so, then you should have mentioned that in your post.I'm sorry but I strongly disagree. \"Be Yourself\" is a such a common non-advice that its only purpose is to makes you feel good. What if you're a psychopath? Just Be Yourself? Where's the self-**improvement** from being yourself? The best advice I could think of or better put it, stop caring about what other people think of you so much. **But**, still make an effort to naturally improve your charisma. Maybe he's coming off a bit too much, too open and expressive. While morally there is nothing wrong with that, it also doesn't hurt to be more relaxed and chill while talking to people.At least you're aware that it's negative and toxic if you're in that state of mind all the time. But I feel you. You're angry right? Passionate emotions knowing that there's alot of injustice in the world. Try to shift from being Cynical to being Rational. We need to learn to calm down (for our health), and think things through. This salesperson is obviously wanting me to buy things. *I need to remind myself that he/she's just a person like me trying to make a living.* Be a little bit more patient with people who are coming off respectfully. And for real jerks, you can tell them to go fuck themselvesI'm afraid of no longer existing. There's no after thought, \"welp I'm dead that sucks\". Nothing. There's no regrets. I'm just gone. Nothingness. And the body I once lived with will rot and decay and eventually dissolve into meaningless particles. My body that onced lived experiences, happiness, sadness and pain. And I wouldn't have any opinion about it. It's not peaceful, I just ceased to exist. And the world will just keep going without me. Even tho I understand it's a part of life, I can't wrap my mind around it. Yeah I don't like pain, but I also don't want to stop existing. I want to live for as long as I can.I've been thinking about this as well for a long time. To the point where I want to understand the \"science\" of it, lol. The science of motivation. Being straight to the fucking point. Motivation is nothing more than an adrenaline rush coming from your brain, your mind. You have to be emotionally attached to the idea of working out, wether it's out of inspiration or desperation. \"I'm not gonna fucking be a lazy fuck this time, I'm gonna get my ass out this sofa and work out and I'm gonna look sexy as **fuck\"** And I watch some workout videos along and sometimes some music helps lolThey have some differences, but for the most part Spartans armor, especially 2s, have always been basically the same. In the lore they basically have the same armor with slight differences, primarily the helmet, to go along with their qualities. Fred has the knife, Linda’s helmet to help with recon, the big differences are the platforms. There was the Mark IV platform which we see Red team wear in wars 1 and 2, the Mark V platform which a lot of Spartans upgraded to, and the Mark VI which Is the platform they’re using here, only it’s gen 3. Gen 2 was way different though and basically every set of armor was different, not an attachment or modification to a current platform. TLDR: Spartans all basically had the same armor for Gen 1 and Gen 3 from the looks of it) because it didn’t make sense to make a million different types or power armor and it would have costed trillions. The different pieces really only extended to different shoulders, helmets, and attachments on the chest and stuff. 343 changed that with the Gen 2 armor which actually had completely different sets.I still don’t think this armor set will be in infinite. Since this is a new company making the toys they’re probably using old armor since it’s new to them, like how Kat is a figure. I think the only armor actually in Infinite they were shown was Mark VII since it’s the default armor, so making figures from other games helps them to not just sell the same Mark VII mold over and over. If it is in the game I think it’ll be the only armor that looks exactly how it did in Reach. The mark VII was originally designed to resemble the mark V B so having it there would be cool.I’m kinda torn on this because I’m an out of stater (originally from Boston) and I’ve always been happy that they let me in here because I don’t think I would ever have had an opportunity to live on the west coast without UCSB. But at the same time I totally get being upset that not enough locals are being excepted. Honestly this feels like a huge failing on the part of the California legislature. Like I pay out of state tuition for a reason, the school should have more funding so they can accommodate everyoneBlow is cocaine. It is usually stored in little plastic bags called “baggies”. This is based off a time when I was at a party my friend through, and everyone contributed to buy an 8-ball. The baggy was just laying out and everyone was lining up and doing as much as they wanted. When no one was looking I yeeted that bad boy into my pocket. Everyone obviously noticed that the baggy was gone and the next day we were trying to figure out who copped it. I played it off like the guy in this meme. Eventually we concluded it was a rando and I pulled off the heist of the century 😎> how many times do I have to tell you that I don’t care about your life experiences And yet you’re the one who said I had “nothing in their life to be proud of”. Like bro, I don’t mean to flex, but I go to a UC school that probably wouldn’t have even looked at your application. And I do real drugs while I’m here. Just seems like I’m handling my shit way more than you are > A video of you doing drugs does not show you know anything about drugs. You realize that’s an oxymoron right? > Can you provide me with ANY justification for the claim you have the slightest idea what you’re talking about when it comes to drugs or the legal and moral topic of drug prohibition? Bro I already linked you to two videos. Peep my profile I have way more > Why do you take such issue with me fighting for the legal right to practice my religion in peace, Because you’re pretending that you do enough drugs for it to be a religion to you. You barely do anything (which you admitted) and the drugs you do are middle school grade BS. You want to pretend to be a drug user you can’t be surprised when a real one calls you out for your shit. It’s stolen valor. If you really don’t get it, try this. Go buy a fake military uniform, complete with a fake Purple Heart and Medal of Honor. Wear it around and start advocating for military benefits. See what the reaction of actual veterans is> You realize these drugs are outright DIFFERENT, right? Yeah, in the same way a shot of southern comfort and a Zima are different. Like maybe you can convince *yourself* that they are the same, but most people who know what they are talking about will see right through that. > Actually, drugs are a field of chemistry. Plenty of chemists understand the drugs you’re using better than you do False. Chemistry might be involved in the creating drugs, but their in a field of their own. A janitor at a hospital can’t treat patients, and a chemist can’t zoot a syringe of heroin the way I can. You probably couldn’t either btw > “Afraid” and “have no interest” are not the same thing. Again, you can tell yourself that but everyone else sees through it > If you want to flex, not that flexing is a good reason to take drugs in the first place, man up and take some drugs that EXPAND your awareness Holy shit bro do you think I only do heroin? Maybe you are afraid to do more than one drug, but I do a little of everything. I do blow and recently got into meth, along with adder all and other uppers. Like you really think I’m not expanding my mind because I don’t do drugs meant for 13 year olds anymore? > I don’t need to make the pain stop, I can take the pain, Project a little harder my guy> I have said multiple times that I am a spiritualist who uses psychedelic drugs as entheogens. So what? That makes you better than me? In my experience hallucinogens are for light weights who can handle stronger drugs. Like I remember doing shrooms when I was in middle school. It was fun, but eventually I grew up and got onto opiates and started doing real drugs rather than jerking myself off on some middle school bullshit > Personally, I think being able to NOT be on drugs long enough to do some basic research on the subject and to formulate a thought Oh bro it’s the opposite. Knowledge comes from experience alone in this field. That’s like saying “I’ve never played basketball before, but that actually makes me more knowledgeable than lebron James about the sport” (and yes, I’m lebron in this example) > Not, for the record, that using drugs intravenously is a bad thing - but pretending it somehow makes you a badass How does it not when you’re afraid to use IV? > Your attitude reflects the kind of person who would stoop to physical violence in response to an intellectual disagreement. Oh man, now I’m started to wonder if you’ve ever used drugs at all? If you had, you would know there is a basic creed among drug users which is “talk shit get hit”. If you ever want to actually start using drugs, you’re gonna have to toughen up my guy> I don’t actually do drugs very often. Lmao this is rich. You’re out here advocating for the legalization of drugs that you don’t even do. You took half a cap of shrooms once and now you think you’re a big time drug user. I got news for you kid, you’re not shit. Do you even use intravenously? I know plenty of people who do actually use everyday along with myself who would smack you down if they heard you. Not even for your political beliefs but because you are a poser. Get back me when you [inject .60 ccs of heroin](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiateChurch/comments/ipo321/the_fattest_thickest_shot_ive_ever_done_60cc_shot/) then I’ll listen to your opinions on drugs> If he's not on the court anymore then what will she do I am so tired of seeing this argument that we have to keep incompetent or unpopular politicians in power because of how it might affect their families. Would it be unfortunate for Mrs. Thomas? Probably. But we can't hold up progress in this country on her behalf. No one elected her to anything. No other job works like that. \"Oh you suck at your job but if we fire you it might negatively effect your family so I guess you can stay forever\". It's a bullshit argument imhoOk I just watched it for anyone wondering. The guy seems to be a little mentally unstable and joking. He says the contract killer line and the cops don’t seem to take him serious. He says he has heroin in one compartment of his luggage and then says “ahh gotcha” when there isn’t any. The airport security check everything in his luggage, scan it multiple times, and give him a body search but don’t find anything. The main security guy scolds him for being disrespectful and turns him over to the police for bloodwork to determine if he’s high, to examine the marijuana seeds, and to find out if there is anything mentally wrong with him. We don’t find out if he is charged with anything>tough tits. get it over it. if you asked your parents if they thought you were spoiled they'd either flat out say yes, or lie through their teeth and say no. Oh I guess you know my parents better than I do then. But you're right, they would probably say something negative about me. It's always been that way, nothings ever good enough for them. Over the years I've learned to pretty much disregard their criticism. >>My parents really don't even give me that much money, they could afford to give me much more. > > spoken like someone who has no idea how good he has it. you're lucky to be getting anything from your parents. Again, spoken like someone who has no idea of how much my parents make and how much they give me. You just don't have the data to be making the claims you're making and it really shows >>I just hope you learn to be less judgmental in the future > >i hope you learn that your addiction will be the bane of you, and that you finally start showing your parents the respect they deserve This is exactly what I was talking about with the judgement. You can either chill out and be a cool dude or keep being salty on the internet, it makes me difference to me. I'll rail out a line in your honor this morning either way 🙃>im not saying you're a \"bad dude\", im saying you're a spoiled brat. Do you not see how its incredibly insulting to say that to someone when you don't really know what they're going through. My parents really don't even give me that much money, they could afford to give me much more. I really don't want to get into a big back and forth with you because you seem to have dug your heels in and have already made up your mind about me based on assumptions. I just hope you learn to be less judgmental in the futureYou just described pretty much every addict chief. Like sorry I like to do drugs and those drugs cost money. You're up on your high horse acting like you're superior to me when you know basically nothing about me. I'm in college and I promise you that I work very, *very* hard. My program is extremely difficult and when I graduate it's going to set me up to be the CCO of a major corporation one day, so I don't want to hear that I'm no a productive member of society. And yeah I do a lot of drugs to study and relax, big deal. I think I've earned it. Everyone uses drugs to study (Adderall) and drugs to relax and come down (alcohol/benzos/others), its a necessity of life. And my parents do have to pay for it, im not going to apologize for that anymore than I would apologize for using their money to buy food or pay for the roof over my head. Like it's the bear minimum. Maybe the memes make it seem like I'm ungrateful or something, but trust me bro you don't know my parents. They are overly controlling and try to treat me like a little kid despite the fact that I'm almost 20 years old. Every dollar they give me has strings attached and they basically try to run my life from thousands of miles away. If you had to deal with it you would use drugs too. Overall man, I don't appriciate the way you're acting like I'm a bad dude over some little shit. You're mad I don't have a job even though I'm in college, and that I use drugs (which I bet you do too because you're in this sub), and what kid doesn't clash with their parents? All in all, the judgment makes you look really bad. These comments say more about you than they do about me chief.> your racist assumption that your race is better at withstanding damage from heroin? That's not what I was saying at all and I resent the accusation. It's well known that people of different races are more or less prone to certain medical conditions. For instance white people are much more likely to have sickle cell anemia, black people are [much more likely to have heart disease](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/aahealth/index.html), etc. That's why when you're doing a medical experiment it's important to have people of all races if you want to apply your results to the entire population. Your study itself says it has implications for the entire Hispanic community rather than everyone. > You're gonna trust the ramblings of a junkie over a scientific journal William S. Burroughs is not some junkie. The man went to Harvard, is often called one of the greatest and most influential writers of the 20th century, and was inducted into the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. He is the father of intellectual heroin use. The man was a genius and I've read everything he's written. Maybe you should try and learn a little about him before you completely dismiss him and his findings.OK first of all this is a study made up of only hispanic men and I am not Hispanic. Secondly, the study doesn't even mention how these men look. That's all we're talking about is that people who use heroin look young, not that heroin is the key to immortality/ the cure of all diseases or anything like that. Thirdly, it says that the participants had lower *self rated* health (addicts are notorious whiners) but they actually had **lower** rates of other diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis than the non heroin using populationAlright, you want a source? Had to go searching through the book but here you go: \"Junkies live a long time and often look younger than they are. When you stop growing you start dying. An addict never stops growing. Most users periodically kick the habit, which involves shrinking of the organism and replacement of the junk dependent cells. Scientists recently experimented with a worms that they were able to shrink by witholding food. By periodically shrinking the worm so it was in continual growth, it's life was prolonged indefinitely. A user is in a continual state of shrinking and growing in his daily cycle of shot-need for junk.\" -William S. Burroughs, *Junky*, 1953The best you can do is to explain the situation to them the best you can. You're right, without an actual diagnosis from CAPS they are not *required* to do anything, but if you meet with a professor and explain everything in a heartfelt and sincere manner they may work with you. Worst case scenario they'll say no and you'll be in the same situation you're in now. You're completely right about the slow turn around time at CAPS really screwing over students. I had a buddy my freshman year who needed a note taker due to a disability. It took CAPS over 3 month to approve it. He had to beg people for notes in all of his classes for months. Just humiliating tbhOK man, I feel you and believe me when I say I've heard all of that before, but the thing is people don't recognize that there is a safe way to do things and if you can stay on that path it doesn't become a problem. It's like the guys in AA, you know? They can't have alcohol because it will ruin their lives and That's just the way it is. It sucks, but those guys just can't have a drink, but they recognize that and live with the limitation. But at the same time there are people who can go out to the bars every weekend and have a couple of drinks and it ever takes over their lives. See, it all depends on the person. Alcohol in and off itself is not inherently good or bad, but some *people* are going to react to it poorly for one reason or another. The key is recognizing what kind of person you are and acting according. H is the same way. There are people who react poorly to it and end up letting it ruin their lives, but there are those who use casually and never let it get too bad. Luckily I'm in the group that can use without things getting too crazy in the same way I can drink alcohol without derailing my life. It's not a moral failing of the people who can't use, it's just biology. Its just how they react to the substance by no fault of their own, and I'm just lucky enough to have been born someone who doesn't react poorly to itYeah I had some homies pass away from it as well. Its really not a drug i would recommend to people who can't handle it. Like if you have an addictive personality then don't touch the stuff. If I didn't have the will power I have it would probably be best to stay away from the needle, but I think if you can use it casually to unwind it's not that big a deal >Fentanyl’s no fucking joke. That I agree with. Luckily I have a very good eye for that sort of stuff, I can spot the discrepancies between laced shit and pure H. Like even dealers have said how impressed they were at how good I was at it>You started with saying stealing coke is something all addicts do >Then you ended with \"I don't have any substance abuse issues big guy. Project a little more\" Wow great word play you caught me in. You must be very proud of that semantic argument. Obviously I didn't mean literally addict, I just meant people who do a lot of coke >Also, give me one example of me acting like I was above you? I'm legit curious as to how you can think that based on what I said Just the way you talked down to me like I was a little kid about to do so,etching stupid, and you're this super smart old guy who knows what's right and wrong. It comes off like you think you know what's better for me than I do. Like you're this better person than I am. Really disrespectful>your decision to steal coke from people and pretend you didn't and That's something that all addicts do >doubling down on taking peoples laundry out of the shared washing machines so you can wash your own. If actually read what I wrote, I said I only do that when I have to because I dont have the money >It doesn't seem like you have much regard or respect for others. I treat everyone in my life very well, but I always shoot people straight and I don't sugarcoat anything. Most people respect me for that but some people can't handle it I guess >I legit can't wrap my head around why you would think I thought I was better than you after reading that long ass post I wrote Because you were acting like you were better than me and talked down to me trying to get me to not do something I wanted to do. >more likely just looking for validation that it's ok to do meth for studying, especially if you already have other substance abuse issues I don't have any substance abuse issues big guy. Project a little more>Its extremely inconvenient to come down to your clothes still wet after paying for and waiting nearly an hour for your clothes to be dry. It also causes your clothes to get wrinkly if they sit there wet. OK, but it's not about that. Like I've never heard of anyone taking someone's laundry out to fuck with them or to make their clothes wrinkly. Like I guarantee it's an issue of not having the cash on hand to do the laundry. Again, it's 75 cents we're talking about, so most people are not going to have a problem paying up if they actually have the money with them. The problem is, who has coins anymore? Or even cash? I know I don't. Sometimes you're down there without any way to pay for a dryer run and you have to do what you have to do to get your clothes dry. If it's any consultation, I promise you no one is doing this to steal your time or money or whatever.Im sorry, but it's pretty clear what they're doing. 12 won. That's the shirt that they are going to sell in stores and are going to use to represent the COE. Despite getting the most votes, #7 is not actually going to be produced or endorsed. People are going to pay them to pre-order, they're going to go to a custom t-shirt printer for exactly that amount of shirts, and then pretend #7 never existed and #12 won the whole time. They're probably going to make themselves a nice profit with the T-shirt sales too, since people are going to pay way too much for the shirt that they should have been able to buy at the bookstore.>Not all addicts steal from their friends. All addicts steal or get stolen from eventually, don't act like you're above this, it comes with the territory. If you really have no idea what this is all about, you probably haven't been in the game very long and you'll learn with time. As for admitting I have sticky fingers, yeah I do. So what? Like i really cant help it. You act like I'm some villain walking around killing people. It's not really that big of a deal. People expect this kind of stuff, or at least they should. Its how the world works. Everyone wants something from you and nothing in this life is free. Like I'm sure most people in my life would rather their stuff go to me than some stranger. And besides man, that's just one thing about me. You don't get to just decide that I'm a bad person because of one trait. Like I'm a complex nuanced human being with a pretty good side to me if everything is weighed out. Like I actualy take pride in being a good dude and really don't like getting called a Douchbag over the internet by some guy who doesn't know me. The judgement doesn't make you look good man.So here's the thing, why is this up to the supreme court at all? Like why did we rely on the court to decide this, and now abortion rights are at the whim of 9 unelected judges. Doesn't it at least kind of make sense for it to go through the legislature who represent the people rather than do this back door thing of having the courts make this decision? I just find it so odd that this major issue hinges on who is appointed on the supreme court. Makes me think that allowing the courts to make this decision in the first place was shortsighted.We can barely get everyone to seriously make an effort to wear masks with a deadly global pandemic, 0% chance they would have done it for the regular flu. We're lucky enough to have laws now that say people can't come into businesses without a mask, and some people still do everything they can to defy that. I dont know what dreamland you're living in, but there is a large percentage of stupid people out there who will ruin things for everyone. The second masks are no longer legally required enough people are going to never wear one again and the flu is going to spread the same way it has every year before this.Ah, one time me and my buddy went to a theater where you had to pick your seats. The lady swiveled a screen around to show us what was available. The whole theater was empty except for two people towards the middle. Before I could say anything, my friend (being a typical asshole) said \"we'll take the seats on both sides of those people\". The seating order ended up being me, a man, his wife, my friend. The rest of the theater was mostly empty. The movie watching experience itself was pretty awful, but after the credits rolled the man asks us if we knew each other, and when we said we did he asked why we did that. My friend just said he thought it would be funny and they kinda got a kick out of that. We ended up hitting it off and had a pretty good discussion about the movie we just watched before we went our separate ways. They were nice people.>I'm not convinced the average, or rather median, voter is even aware of the rule change on cloture votes. I don't think Senate procedure has ever been mentioned as a top issue among voters. When its happening, you're absolutely right no one pays attention to procedural changes. But as soon as people start feeling the effects of those changes down the road, they start looking for someone to point the finger at. So yes, when the procedures changed very few people even noticed. But once Garland and Kavanaugh were appointed with <60 votes, a lot of people went \"what the heck?\". It was at that point that they were bombarded with the fact that democrats changed the rules years prior. That's how the government typically operates though. No one can really be bothered to read endless bills or keep up with senate committee hearings, but once it affects their everyday lives people want to know everything about how things got this way.They let him do it and take the flak for it. Absolutely do not do the dirty work for him. The republicans have spent the last 8 years saying \"well its the *democrats* who instituted the nuclear option\". That matters a lot to the average voter. The democrats have been paying a political price for that ever since, and i guarantee they wish it was the republicans who were paying it. That decision contributed to them losing ~~the house in 2010 and~~ the senate in 2014. So I just dont think its very compelling to say it was the right move because the republicans might have done it themselves at a later date.>The problem is you assume that a Republican minority that was willing to violate norms and deny all opposing judges wouldn't also violate the norms and eliminate the nuclear option anyway once they were the majority. Maybe they would, but don't do the work for them. They've spent the last 8 years sayings \"its the *democrats* who instituted the nuclear option\". I understand that may ring hollow to you, but that means a lot to your average voter. The democrats are still paying a political price for that decision, i guarantee they wish it was the republicans who were paying it. >I believe they have demonstrated now that they will always escalate, even if it destroys the integrity of the institution whose limits they are pushing. Then the democrats need to practice deescalation, not escalate things further. This is what we demand of our police, why not of our politicians? >Plus, the lopsided nature of the Senate means the Republicans can control it even when the nation overwhelmingly votes Democrat. Statistically that gives them control of the courts in the long run, because they know if they play hardball they will control both the presidency and the Senate 2-3x as often as the Democrats. So does that mean they are 2-3x as likely to gain control over the seats that the democrats add? Do you not see how that demonstrates how short sighted court packing is. Yes we get 2 liberal judges *right now*, but how long can we possibly keep them? What would you say in 20 years if those added seats are the sole reason that the supreme court is a 9-2 conservative majority?Ok I understand all of your points and I think there's a lot of legitimacy to where your coming. That being said, I cant help but feel like we're playing with fire here. It's like when the Republicans weren't voting for any Obama judges when they were the minority party from 2008-2010. So what do the democrats do? Reduced the required votes from 60 to a simple majority, \"the nuclear option\". It seemed like a good idea at the time and Obamas judges start getting confirmed. BUT, this very rule comes back to bite them in the ass and its the reason that Garland, Kavanaugh, and possibly Barrett can be confirmed (as well as countless lower court judges). I understand the rationale for court packing, and I certainly understand the high emotions that make that such an attractive option, but it just seems like such a myopic approach to me. What happens if the democrats add 3 justices, and the next time the Republicans are in power they add 5? What happens if all 3 of these justices die during a republican administration? Its like you said, Republicans are willing to play dirty. Court packing is technically legal and legitimate, so democrats are entertaining that. But what if they aren't willing to play dirty enough to hold onto those seats? Then they're just handing the Republicans 3 future seats.>Only downside (at least for me) is it'll be chock full of Reagan photos, not just Obama ones. I mean that makes perfect sense to me. Reagan was really the first president to perfect managing the way his image was presented to the American people. As a former movie star he understood the value of a good production when it came to televised appearances. Doesnt surprise me that he also invested a lot in presidential photography. People still study some of the campaign media tactics that the Reagan campaign pioneered, makes sense that photography is the same way.It was you who implicitly said that the experiences of addicts don't matter by making the conversation all about gay people. I was merely responding to the claim that gay people had it worse. I really did not want to get into an argument about who has suffered the most oppression, but if you're going to drag it out of me once again, I stand by my statement that addicts have it worse than gay people. But I want to remind you that constantly attacking me and my stance does not help anyone. You seem intent on dividing us which only helps the oppressors. I've noticed that this is a common trend among oppressed groups is once they walk through a door they try to close it behind them so no other groups can make it. \"Fuck you, I got mine\" type of thinking. I understand why you make the distinction between addicts and gay people, but in my mind they are one and the same in terms of being an *oppressed group*. Thats why I don't buy this idea that the converaation was about gay people and gay people alone. I think that whenever you are brought up, you have a responsibility to stand for your fellow oppressed members of society, otherwise you are just as bad as the oppressors you claim to be against. Neutrality only helps the perpetrators, never the victim. So sure, you can try to make the argument that we were only talking about gay people, and that mentioning addicts was \"derailing\" as you put it, but I see what you're doing. Its a subversive tactic that lets you wash your hands of issues that don't directly affect you. If you dont believe that I deserve the same level of rights as you, thats fine. I've dealt with this from almost everyone my entire life, its honestly nothing new. But don't stand there and pretend that you care so you can feel good about yourself. The whole thing is a practice of pretentious showmanship to lift yourself up personally while putting down an entire group of people that I happen to be a part of.>Cause the topic was about gay people being oppressed by religious intolerance. If you wanted to talk about addicts, maybe don't derail a conversation to get to that point. Do you not see how thats an issue? Nobody wants to talk about me or my struggles and the fact that a conversation needs to be \"derailed\" for anyone to even be reminded that I exist is the problem. If the covnersation is always about gay people and gay rights, maybe you're having the wrong conversations. >Also, I shouldn't have to explain Pride, but since you asked...Pride is in celebration of the decades of fighting for gay rights, of solidarity for those still oppressed for being LGBT+ to this very day, for those in the closet who haven't come out yet, for those in countries where being gay is still a crime punishable by death, and many other forms of community support and solidarity within the community. And im not knocking any of that, I think thats all fine and great, but you have to step back and recognize your privilege that you have that. Like its a response to some terrible thing, but its still a recognition of support and solidarity for you that I will never experience. If you really want to dive into the oppression Olympics, you have to recognize that significant leg up that you have on other groups. >Hopefully one day, addicts will be able to join in similar solidarity, and fight against persecution. If that's something you truly think would help raise awareness and visibility to help combat these issues, then I would be all in support for a movement like that. You should not have to live in shame, and I will support you in that. Well support starts at a local level. You have to change the way that you think about addicts and the way you treat us. You don't get to sweep us under the rug and ice us out of conversations just because we are not identical to you in terms of struggle and our path to equalityI'm not religious, I was just explaining what they believe. And I wasn't trying to get into a pissing match about whose more oppressed, but if you want to go there fine: people who struggle with addiction have it way worse in this country than gay people. You can still be thrown in prison for addiction. Being gay has been totally legal for decades. People still look down on intravenous drug use as spreading disease and think that I'm a bad person for needle based consumption of opiates, meanwhile people accept gay people in all facets of life. There was even an openly gay person running for president this year.>So who the hell cares if she's liked by her students or not. I had some lousy teachers in college who were loved by their students. Well I doubt the students at Notre Dame Law School like her because she plays movies in class or something. Anyone who gets in there has to be pretty smart and have a burning desire to learn the law, so any professor who is well liked there has to be pretty good at what they do. And if you think about it, (if she gets confirmed) we are all about to become her students in a way. The supreme court interprets the law and teaches us how it should be applied. All the lawyers in this country will continue to learn from her as long as she serves on the bench, so I guess it's nice to hear what her current students think.**The Dark Knkght** 36th - absolutely deserves the spot. Masterful movie with a riveting performance from Heath Ledger **Inception** 120th - mindbending film with excellent performances by the ensemble cast **Memento** 167th - experimental film style that created a unique and fantastic mystery, that is praised for its accurate depiction of anterograde amnesia **Interstellar** 408th - a visually impressive space epic that earns its place on the lower end of the list imo **The Prestige** 422nd - regarded as one of Nolans weaker films but one of my personal favorites, the strong performance of the leads and development of Nolans signature non-linear story telling earn it enough praise to make the list. It all seems about right in my eyesHere's the frustrating thing, it won't let me add a bicycle. Whenever I go into my account, [I have the option to select me vehicles](http://imgur.com/a/LmPvNNZ) If I click on that, [it shows me my current car and gives me the option to add a new vehicle](http://imgur.com/a/S6VBJh1) But whenever I try to add a new one, [it only lets me input another car](http://imgur.com/a/z4RgtFK) No one i talked to seems to know how to add a bicycle as a vehicle option, i was hoping someone on here has gone through thisI know that its technically all legal because we're independent contractors, my point was that it was a scummy policy that im happy they changed. There's an understanding that you're going to get $3 from the company no matter what, hence why its called \"base pay\". To take that away and supplement it with tips is not fair to the drivers. DD is paying you nothing in that situation. The company literally wouldn't exist without the drivers and they had situations where they paid them $0 for deliveries.>If you're referring to doordash keeping tips they don't and never have. There has been some shady policies regarding the tips, it even resulted in a class action suit against the company at one point. https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/8/20/20825937/doordash-tipping-policy-still-not-changed-food-delivery-app-gig-economy https://web.archive.org/web/20190805221244/https://gothamist.com/2019/07/30/doordash_tipping_lawsuit.php *Edit to explain why people are upset: The old policy was that if the tip was over the base pay, the base pay would be reduced and the driver would only get the tip. This allowed DD to say \"they keep 100% of the tip\". So if a customer tipped $5, the driver would get $5 instead of 5 plus the $3 from base pay. Here's the problem, if there's an understanding that I get $3 base pay, then I am owed $8 when the customer tips $5. So DD is *technically* not taking my tip, but they are still stealing money from me and calling it something else.>>So if a jury acquits someone who committed a crime, thats clearly the \"wrong\" outcome. > >Whether or not Kavanugh sexually assaulted his accusers is an objective fact. > >I'd say that the Senate confirming a judge, responsible for meting out justice, that has sexually assaulted more than one woman is clearly the \"wrong\" outcome. And thats your take on it. When a jury is deliberating on whether or not someone is guilty of sexual assualt, that objective fact of what happened is the only thing at play. The senate was trying to figure out if he was qualified for the job, and there are many things that need to be considered and many different metrics that need to be applied. Things like accusations and behavior are things that need to be considered, but they are not the only factors being examined as they would be in a jury trial. The senate was not tasked with finding the truth of these allegations, they were tasked with determining if he was qualified, and a piece of that is figuring out if the accusations were credible. That may sound subtle, but there's actually a huge difference between the two. The messed up part is I dont even like Kavanaugh but I think what youre saying is missing the mark, so to speakI think the difference is that juries are factfinders who are trying to establish objective truth, vs. Job interviewers who are making subjective choices between candidates. So if a jury acquits someone who committed a crime, thats clearly the \"wrong\" outcome. If a CEO hires someone who i dont like personally, I cant really say that that decision was \"wrong\", even if its not what I would do. I think that interviewers have their own opinions, and its a subjective enough process that nothing is really incorrect.>In defense of this one, there's been a lot of amusing articles about Trump supporters unable to get dates on apps like Tinder and Bumble. Those articles are about people who work directly for Trump in Washington DC, like staffers. It really only applies to them because of the unavoidable question of \"who do you work for\". A regular person who happens to support trump could just ... not mention it, or like, lie. Its a very small group (unmarried staffers of the president) that you're extrapolating to half the nation.I see what your saying, but I think you're overestimating how much focus goes into once you get used to it. Do you focus on balancing yourself everytime you're on a bike? Not really, because it just becomes so natural to you after a while that your body just kind of does it. To someone who has only ever driven with training wheels, balancing on the bike might seem cumbersome which would make the ride unenjoyable, but you really get used to it. To each their own and if you like automatics don't let anyone tell you not to drive them, but everyone who learns manual feels they are difficult at the beginningThats how it starts for everyone. Honestly it took me a week of practicing in a parking lot before I felt comfortable getting on a public road. But you get the hang of it remarkably quick, and by the end of the first year you will have completely mastered it and not even think about what you're doing. Its kind of like riding a bike. When you first learn how you're spending so much time thinking about trying to balance, peddle the right speed, steer, etc. that it feels down right dangerous to be on one. But over time you get the hang of it and it becomes really fun to ride around. In my view its the same with manual cars. Scary when youre learning, but once you get into it you really start to love it.> Heroin does worse things to the individual using it, Like what? >Heroin is more lethal and addicting than alcohol. Again, I think you may be saying that because you've been primed to think that by society. Alcohol is legal and a very lucrative business, because of that the business executives can afford better marketing making you *think* its a lot better than heroin. Its the old fallacy of \"legal=safe\". I have never seen a study that indicates that heroin is more addictive or deadly alcohol, and I've actually seen things that suggest the opposite. Again alcohol is the only drug with lethal withdrawals. That in and off itself tips the scales a little bit for me. I'm not saying that you're lying on purpose, but I think that you have been exposed to alcohol marketing throughout your life that has led you to believe its not a lethal, addictive drug. When the Controlled substances act was passed through congress in 1970, it included a subsection that excluded alcohol and tobacco from scheduling (no doubt lobbied for by the industries). If that subsection was not included, alcohol would be considered a schedule 1 substance, the exact same as heroin.None of that is a comparison of heroin and alcohol and tobacco. Obviously heroin isn't good for you. Nothing is. Sugar isn't good for you, fast food isnt good for you, everything that feels good is probably pretty bad for you. People still choose to do those things because they want to enjoy themselves. If you want to avoid everything bad for you, you'll have to lock yourself away in a monastery and not really live. But I find it odd that some drugs are seen as \"cringe\" and some are just fine. No one would have problem with a video of me ripping some shots of alcohol, but you can very easily overdose that way. Exponentially more people die from Alcohol poisoning every year than heroin overdose. As for addiction, alcohol is the only drug that has withdrawals that can kill you. Heroin withdrawal might be bad, but no one can die from the withdrawals themselves. If you drink enough alcohol and then stop, you will *die*. Everyone who has ever looked down or discriminated against me because of heroin usage has drank alcohol. I'm willing to bet that you do as well. Just because we have a different drug of choice, you feel superior to me.Yeah, but what if a lot more than a basketball court full of people show up. What if a couple dozen people show up and they want autographs and hear stories about the set of Fresh Prince. What if, while youre working your way through all of these people, they're texting their friends and family in the area who are all driving to the park asap to meet you and do the same thing all over again. People trying to get your contact information and give you a copy of their screenplay. Probably never get to play a game of pickup basketball again>It's also not always 100% all or nothing with affairs, where the cheater is to blame. Who knows what their private life was like, but clearly Arnie wasn't committed to his wife. Could it have been 100% his fault, sure, maybe, 95%? 60%? We'll never know truly. Can you explain a situation where it wouldn't be 100% the cheaters fault? Sure there's stuff like open marriages, but then its not cheating if you have another partner. If you're about to say that Arnold and his wife weren't happy together, then he should have came clean and divorced her before taking on another partner. If he still loved his wife, but also this other woman, he should have explained that to his wife and if she was not ok with it (which most people would almost certainly not be), he should have respected that and ended the relationship with one of them. I'm not saying Arnold should be burnt at the stake, but I see the cheating as 100% his fault. I still think he's an admirable guy, but you can't explain this away. He's a human and he has his faults, but don't pretend this isn't a fault.>Then you have to make the decision, do I keep holding while the debt builds, or do you less at a loss? In what world is something like VTI not going to go up overtime? Like if the entire stock market is crashing and not recovering over the course of *years*, you have much bigger problems. You're whole contention seems to revolve around the fact that he might need to sell off to pay some of his debt, but student loans are the one type of debt that's pretty much impossible for that to happen. Like if he makes a minimum payment one year and puts the rest of his money in the stock market, he will never really need to take that money out. Even if he lost his job the very next year, he wouldn't need to sell his shares because his payment would also drop. It would be different if it was a car payment or something.> The downside is that you are forced to sell low to pay your debts in a downturn, potentially at a big loss, which is much worse than the upside. But student loans are unlike any other debt in that the payments are based off of your income. If your income goes down, the amount of money that you have to pay each year goes down as well, never more than 10% of yoir discretionary income. Never any reason to sell your shares to pay that debt. Even if your income really was 0, your student loan payments that year would be 0. So why would he not let that money ride in the market?Ok so lets say he took his money and invested in VTI, the total stock market index fund. Its up 70% over the last five years. So even if we take the high end of your example and say he has a 7% interest rate on his loans, that would only be 35% for the past 5 years. So if he had the option of putting his money in the market vs. putting it into his loans, his still beating his interest rate by double by putting it into the market. And that's just if he put it into the total market. If he picks stocks that beat the market then he's in an even better position. If, for example, Tesla continues to perform the way it has then anyone who invested in it now will be doing a lot better than people who pay off their loans right away. Am I missing something? I might be off base here but thats how it looks to me.>Working in alphabet city, I’ve seen how heroine makes people into half-folded-standing-zombies and try to have conversations and all you hear is mumbles. Having to walk in front of a methodone clinic daily (which was disgusting) to get to work gave me a lot more insight than I wanted. Do you think maybe thats giving you a skewed perspective? Its like if your only experience with airplanes is watching videos of plane crashes. You would think that airplanes are very unsafe. If you hang around a methadone clinic you're only going to see people who can't handle their shit. There are a lot of people who can do H without falling into a pit. Even if I did get to a point that I was too zoned, i would just do some blow to come back up. The beauty of downers is that you can just cancel it out with an upper. >You want to do drugs? Enjoy. Not with your kids though. I'm with my kids like 24/7, so whats your solution guy?The author also just put out a book called [team of five](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062668974) about the lives of former presidents. The fact that all the white house staff loved the Bush family is reiterated. Shortly after leaving the white house, Barbara Bush called up her favorite aide who had always helped her with computers to walk her through how to set up her home PC. The area code of the incoming call was flagged and the next day Hillary Clinton fired the aide because she was convinced he was sending secrets to the Bushs.> This is vigilantism and not ok. Exactly. Its a crime and he belongs in prison. Never said anything to the contrary. But vigilantism is clearly more sympathetic than a hate crime. That doesnt mean that its ok or that he should go free, all it means is that you can understand why he did it. What father wouldn't want to go beat up a drug dealer who sold to his sons in elementary school? As a father of a young kid, I would *want* to do the same thing if happened to my son even though I never would. Thats where the sympathy comes in.He didnt murder the guy, he was in for assualt. And what seemed to happen was that Schillinger heard that the dealer was selling to children (which is a terrible, terrible thing). Instead of just beating the guy up based on rumors, he had his kids go and buy from the guy to see if it was true. Once it was confirmed, he took action to stop him from selling to more kids and getting them addicted to drugs. Having his kids go buy from the guy was not a trap, it was a test. A test that the dealer failed.>Can Fox News please also address that one song by Ted Nugent where he sexualized 13 year olds Thats not the same. An artist can talk about fictional things, theres a big difference between singing about something and actually doing something. If Chris brown had just sung a song about abusing women, but never did it in real life, i don't think many people would care. As long as ted nugent isn't actually having sex with 13 year old girls it is not on the same level as Chris Brown *actually* abusing women.I dont think its doable considering the first amendment. The government is not allowed to punish people for what they say. You want to make it illegal for a group of people to say certain things. Thats unconstitutional on its face. Thats why the original \"stolen valor\" cases were struck down. A politician in California claimed to have been shot down in Afghanistan but never even served. The Supreme Court ruled that while his speech was morally detestable, it is still protected by the first amendment.A good leader identifies talent within their ranks and gives them tasks to match their skills. A general doesnt charge into every battle that his troops are engaged in, he has officers that he trusts with that responsibility. As we see in the show, no one considered Hernandez a weak leader because he didn't show up to one meeting. For all we know he was handling more important things within the Latino gang. The issue of whether august hill is protected is largely irrelevant, I think Hernandez may have rolled his eyes at the notion and sent a Sergent because he had better things to do.You see this explored subtly throughout the show. The different leaders of the latino gang have very different leadership styles. When Miguel was in charge, he was very passive and did not jump at the chance to go to war. El cid had a more guns blazing attitude and advanced the Latinos into the drug trade, but this eventually got him killed as he pissed off the homeboys and Italians enough that they let him be killed without consequences. Hernandez had a lot of the same attitudes as El cid, but he was a lot more cunning about it . While he was involved in most of the business going on in Oz, he believed in delegation and flying under the radar. You see this when he gets Rebadow to kill El Cid instead of doing it himself. He probably sent a representative to the meeting to shield him from any criticism in case the decision was poorly recieved.>So you'll tell the truth? > >Hey America, there's a pandemic coming and even though we know masks work, we're gonna ask you to be mindful and let the medical personal use them, cause they need it more. > >How would that play out? People would run and start buying masks and *use* them. Some people would stock up heavily and resell them to people who would *use* them. There would be a shortage, and companies would have to produce more in a short period of time to sell them to people who would *use* them. I think a line of people clamoring to get a mask would be a good thing as long as they wore them.Hey I'm just going to confess this was my necro smasher my friend wanted me to name it this back in middle school. I'm a full grown man now and I deleted this name like, 3 years ago? I'm just saying this cause this means anyone can change. I'm happy I've grown as a person and if I can change, anyone can. This is my apology for this. As for \"he thought it was the funniest thing\" part, I never talked about or used this weapon in my entirety of TF2, this is post is acting like you met me in a server. Sorry to anyone who deals with this shit currently. I hope things get better and there aren't anymore assholes like me in the world eventually. I hope they change just like I can.I'm in the LGBT community. Also I said I haven't seen anything and I thought it was important since I am on this community a lot, it's my most visited subreddit and I assumed the fact since I'm a huge FNAF fan and search FNAF daily on this reddit to see any news or theories. I haven't seen any discussion on anything related to Scott except the character's he's created of course. Now I'm sorry that you're upset by the news as I was too. Extremely. Being part of a community and then someone you've looked up to basically says \"fuck you\" is heart breaking but I think he didn't donate for those specific reasons, I remember reading somewhere it was more for an economical reason (I am 70% sure it was on his last post) and the donations weren't meant to go towards the hateful things those politicians do, although he may not have meant it, it doesn't erase the fact he's done it. Just in case you want to know what part of the community I am from, I am unlabeled (non-binary spectrum) and I have a trans masculine boyfriend I love dearly. I have since forgiven Scott since he apologized and it seemed genuine as I don't like to dwell on things too long. My point is banning FNAF doesn't solve anything, ban discussions relating to politics is my standpoint, thanks for sharing yours and sorry for the entire novel of a response.Most people didn't, I'd say about 60% of people don't know anything about the FNAF creator and the controversy. The fact the mods aren't banning Jeepers Creepers or Stephen King conversation shows they just don't want FNAF topics in the subreddit. Banning politics outright should be the main goal instead of using it as a disguise to ban something against their personal bias. I'm a member of the LGBT community and I couldn't give less of a shit about what Scott did. He's donated more money to LGBT charities than against them. This is all just a huge ruckus for no reason. Ban politics, not talking about a green bunny.Halloween, I grew up as a kid with my Uncle always dressing up as Michael Myers for Halloween night and going out scaring the kids. He doesn't do it anymore but ever since I saw him do that as a kid I just watched the movies over and over again. I watched all movies at least 50 times, I have every single mask and knife prop. Funko pops, etc. I saw a game in 2016 adding Michael Myers as a character so I immediately bought it for my PS4. I still play it to this day and Michael is still my highest level killer. All because of my cool Uncle Tony.Let's for example, say that a black streamer is streaming. They have endgame chat turned off to avoid this stuff from happening again, and they have mods on their stream to ban people entering and causing trouble. Right? That's fair. But, then people will find a way into the game they are playing to get the message across. Blackface Bubba was their little message sender. You cannot avoid that unless you leave the game, which most have. It was done on purpose and not a coincidence of \"oh it's just a Bubba camping like normal\" because their name would be (N Slur) Killer.I feel like if it was Candyman it would be a full chapter to live up to the hype and have a survivor from the new movie TBH. Predator is my go to simply because there isn't a main protagonist that stays in all the movies like Laurie Strode, Tommy Jarvis, or Sidney Prescott, and the timing of Fortnite getting Predator matches up with DBD since it was around a year ago, and if discussions with Predator were being made, it would be right about now as a release. Almo said the new killer would have a special pickup and destroy pallet animation, which I actually think is dragging a survivor, and shooting the pallet with his laser mounted gun (I'm crazy I know) Chucky doesn't make sense since Andy would be his survivor, and this paragraph doesn't have a survivor. But what do you think about Jack Torrance or Pennywise?\n",
