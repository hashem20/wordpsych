get psych info from words

Mental illness is quite prevalent: about 46% of people during their lifetime and 20% if we look at the yearly stats. Compared to other illnesses, a mental one is harder to detect and it usually takes years before a person gets a diagnosis. Most of the obstacles in the way to seek a proper diagnosis and help in time originate from our collective attitudes against these types of physical illnesses. Itâ€™s difficult to talk about our personal struggles. The aim here is to develop a tool to get you an estimate of your mental health profile without needing to talk to other people. WordPsych gets a sample text and returns similarity scores indicating how much the input text was similar to the texts authored by people with different psychological conditions including depression, anxiety, ptsd, adhd, autism, etc.
