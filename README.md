Mental illness is quite prevalent: about 46% of people during their lifetime and 20% if we look at the yearly stats. Compared to other illnesses, a mental one is harder to detect and it usually takes years before a person gets a diagnosis. Most of the obstacles in the way to seek a proper diagnosis and help in time originate from our collective attitudes against these types of physical illnesses. Itâ€™s difficult to talk about our personal struggles. The aim here is to develop a tool to get you an estimate of your mental health profile without needing to talk to other people.
